Here is why Wandry matters. Our current system imposes a gift tax of up to 35% when taxpayers give assets away, with exceptions. Individuals now get one $5.12 million lifetime exemption, and they can also give up to $13,000 of assets a year to an unlimited number of recipients. (Next year the lifetime break is scheduled to drop to $1 million and the top rate to rise to 55%.)

The U.S.-led coalition routinely reports each time an American or other foreign soldier is killed by an Afghan in uniform, but the military is under-reporting the number of overall attacks. The Associated Press reported earlier this month that the International Security Assistance Force, or ISAF, does not report attacks in which the Afghan wounds  or misses  his U.S. or allied target. It also doesn't report the wounding of troops who were attacked alongside those who were killed.
Set designer Bjorn G. Amelan has supplied transparent room-dividers and a sofa, wryly suggesting that Jones’ memories resemble mental furniture. Much of this brilliant work, set to an eclectic score by Ted Coffey, depends upon a tension between the immediacy of lived experience—dancing, or biting into a juicy, green apple—and our subsequent need to measure, re-arrange and transmit our impressions before they vanish forever.

Thus, San Antonio and Oklahoma City posted the top two records in the West. San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich, not the Coach of the Year for nothing, defiantly rested his stars in a rebuke to the 66-game sprint. It worked; the Spurs won 50 games. Oklahoma City's best players aren't old enough to know tired.
"She's happy for me, but she's still on me with the grades," Williams said. "She's glad I'm getting a scholarship so she doesn't have to pay for anything.

The sisters didn’t even know where he was buried. After their mother died in 2009, they started searching the Internet for any information on Moszek “Mike” Zanger. They soon learned more than their mother ever knew about his final months, thanks to the dogged work of a pair of World War II buffs.
Then comes the defense, which has played outstanding all season and deserves much credit for those gaudy goalie stats. And not only do they protect the net, they produce. Kevin Shattenkirk's 23 points ranks 18th in the league among defensemen and Alex Pietrangelo comes in right behind him with 21 points, good enough for 26th among defensemen. And with Shatty (plus-17), Petro (+14) and Barret Jackman (+13), the Blues have three defensemen who rank in the top

Stotik's the auteur, a visionary who inhabits his mind strongly and makes it come alive through his work, and seemingly has little time for anything else. Though brilliant and educated, he's often worked labor and construction jobs in order to make a living. While he doesn't appear overprotective, Stotik is discreet about his private affairs.

A: I think it was absolutely right. What happened with King Crimson is that Ian McDonald and Mike Giles decided that they didn't want to go touring anymore. They decided they just wanted to make records in the studio. And so, they left King Crimson. That was it. The band was over. Now, we could have replaced two people, but I just didn't feel it was right. Ian and Mike were so important in that band. I said to Robert (Fripp) at the time, "I'll form a new band if you like. But I just don't feel right about carrying on the name King Crimson.
At 29, Randolph had another All-Star-caliber season, averaging 20.1 points and 12.2 rebounds and shooting 50.3 percent from the field. And he has kept the Grizzlies not just afloat, but thriving after they lost Rudy Gay for the season to a shoulder injury.

Santorum didn’t. He overthought. He overcorrected. He overdid. He spent so much time explaining the process by which he voted for this, or why he’d originally done that, and the difficulty in his position that led him to do the other, that he never made a positive case for himself.

Strangely, the shift in the tight game came courtesy of two huge three-pointers by Holiday in the fourth quarter. With the Sixers leading, 74-73, and Holiday having made only six of 21 shots, the third-year guard rose from 27 feet with the confidence he always seems to have. With 4 minutes, 13 seconds left the ball went through, the fans erupted and the weight of the world appeared to lift off Holiday’s back.

A: Thanks for the tutorial and, no, you're not the first to bring this to my attention -- and you're not the first to completely misinterpret the lyric and miss the metaphor. Believe me, I've consumed enough alcoholic beverages in my time to know how they are made and what the proper nomenclature is. But that line in the song has little or nothing to do with alcoholic beverages. It's a sociopolitical statement. My only regret would be having to explain it in detail to you, which would defeat the purpose of using literary devices in songwriting and lower the discussion to some silly and irrelevant argument about chemical processes.

When it works, though, it is a sight to behold. The Americans looked like a cat toying with a mouse for much of the first half of the final, reeling defenders in only to make the ball disappear with a deft flick or smooth pass to a teammate. Japan's confusion and frustration gave the Americans wide-open spaces in front of the goal, and they easily could have been up 4-0 at halftime.

As weird as this is going to sound, I think tearing my ACL was, and I say that because it kind of reinvited the love I have for the game.

When I was able to play again, it was such a blessing that I could because the opportunity to play can just be taken away in a day.

Yes, it is intimate, but that's why we're subject to very high standards of confidentiality and a very strong ethical code. An accountant who doesn't do the right thing gets into a lot of trouble. For example, if I got caught doing something 'funny,' I would get punished far more than the average individual because I'm a professional that should know better. We get a newsletter every few months from the California Board of Accountancy that divulges all the accountants in California who are in trouble. It's very serious - monkey business is not allowed.

Many residents of Hadley Township, a historic century-old primarily African-American neighborhood, have been living in limbo for several years, waiting to see if there will be redevelopment. At first, many neighbors did not want to move. Later, many expressed a desire to know one way or the other. Many now want to be bought out.
"As years go by, we as police officers become hardened and cynical; we sometimes lose focus on the true purpose and reason for our mission," Isom said. "We begin to think in terms of us versus them, and what they owe us for service. But David will always be in that special place where we all started. He had it right. It's we, not them. It's what we owe them, not what they owe us."
With him out and other injuries to the team's defenders, second-string players and walk-ons saw plenty of playing time. That's good from a development standpoint, but it doesn't let fans see how an area of concern has come along since last year.

I’ve been fortunate to cover a few hospital stories over the past year with the Chicago Tribune. While it may sound like an emotionally wrenching assignment, I use the word "fortunate" because I feel that it’s an honor telling the stories of patients going through such hardships.

Linda Wilson: You are right that the left of the two left turn lanes is a continuous flow for traffic to eastbound Manchester. Really the only people that should be stopping in the right left turn lane are those want to cross over to go to West County Mall. We do keep an eye on this, but we didn't want to put a signal in to stop the main flow of Manchester traffic. I will have our traffic engineer double check the volumes on these turns again.

Grohl is a wiseguy, but he was dead serious about his obligation to provide maximum entertainment at wall-shaking volume. His band — as tight and taut as a guitar string after months of touring behind their latest album, "Wasting Light" — played for nearly three hours, and he spent much of that time running around the stage like a spray-paint vandal chased by the cops.
Officials said McEady, 48, of Camden, failed to mention the beating in a report, and the inmate didn’t speak up. Instead, the Department of Corrections began to investigate after a routine review of a video showing the inmate’s transfer.

Im not about equality of result when it comes to income inequality. There is income inequality in America. There always has been, and hopefully, and I do say that, there always will be. Why?

Holliday is no longer the girl who went from the choir of Houston's Pleasant Grove Baptist Church to a role in the musical "Your Arms Too Short to Box With God" and then to Michael Bennett's Supremes-inspired "Dreamgirls."

Air samplings along the south edge of the property, which is lined by houses, showed methane concentrations of 30 to 40 percent a couple of years ago, Schwarz said. Methane's explosive range is between 5 and 15 percent concentration; heavier than that and there isn't enough oxygen to sustain a fire, but the higher readings were still troubling. However, the most recent readings were "quite low," below 5 percent, and the methane extraction system is "working quite well," he says.
Meanwhile, old Hollywood continued to appear on the show. It was a one-of-a-kind clash of cultures.

In case you've jumped to the conclusion that Pizzeria Ortica may have been inspired by Pizzeria Mozza, I'd say you're probably right. What chef wouldn't want to emulate the success of the Silverton-Batali juggernaut? But Pizzeria Ortica is not a carbon copy. For one thing, the menu includes pasta, some of the best in Southern California, plus a fine antipasti and salad menu, and a handful of well-conceived main courses.
Saturday afternoon, referee Karl Hess ejected two former N.C. State greats — former NBAer Tom Gugliotta and Chris Corchiani — from the Wolfpack's game against Florida State. Hess refused to answer why he tossed two fans from the game. That's just another example of the officials flexing their muscle, but with no accountability. We're not asking that all officials — the majority of whom do an excellent job under tough circumstances — explain every decision, but there needs to be a system put into place where questions can be asked or things explained. It will make everyone's lives much easier. In the instance on Saturday, what is the harm in explaining why Gugliotta and Corchiani were tossed? Or more commonly, where is the downside in giving the reasoning behind a disputed foul call at the end of a game? There is none. Officials — like coaches and players — should enter the realm of having a forum answer tough questions when the situations call for it.

The airport is also seeking to attract more carriers. On Tuesday, the county Board of Supervisors authorized a $250,000 cash offer to Virgin America to lure it to Sacramento. That money would come from an existing program funded by airport restaurants and shops.
What advice would you give incoming freshmen? That they should get involved. Getting involved with the things that interest a student will teach him far more than a classroom ever could.

Another find is the Chopra Center, which moved from La Jolla to the La Costa Resort. Deepak Chopra, the most popular evangelist of traditional Indian medicine, has his U.S. headquarters in a resort surrounded by tennis pros and polo-shirted golfers. For a while, Chopra was offering a way to integrate Indian mental centering techniques with golf – though I didn't see it on the spa menu. The materials did mention that those with a "pitta dosha" personality (one of the Ayurvedic body types) can be especially angry when they hit a bad shot. There is a full menu of yoga and meditation. It's a world within the La Costa world – and one that fits the word "east."
School construction manager Dave Tillou said there is good news.

That's not to say that an Exelon-Constellation merger is a great thing. It still takes a corporate headquarters out of Baltimore, and as EDF officials have pointed out, it greatly diminishes the chances for the construction of a new nuclear reactor at Calvert Cliffs and will almost certainly result in the loss of high-paying jobs here. But the criteria on which the Public Service Commission can judge this deal are narrow: Does it provide benefits for BGE customers, does it produce no harm for them, and is it in the public interest? With the terms Mr. O'Malley secured, the commission should be able to answer all three in the affirmative.

MIT and Harvard officials emphasized that they would use the new online platform not just to build a global community of online learners but also to research teaching methods and technologies. Online courses with thousands of students give researchers the ability to monitor students' progress, they said, identifying what they click on and where they have trouble. Already, a researcher from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, using the MIT Circuits course, found that students overwhelmingly preferred to read the handwritten notes of Agarwal rather than the same notes presented on PowerPoint.

Anyone who benefited from the transaction can be found liable for the fraudulent transfer in suits filed on behalf of the debtor's estate.

And because fraudulent conveyance claims are difficult and expensive to litigate, the creditors and banks most often agree to settle the case early on.

øA: The ECB changed what could be collateral for the European banks, which is important. They made what a bank can use as collateral much wider, and they put unlimited use of three-year lending. It was a huge move, much bigger than the market reaction we saw. It's possible that this one thing has removed all funding issues for the big European banks. It gives them breathing room and can help support asset prices in the meantime. The European banks are still being forced to raise capital and by that, they still have to sell assets. They're being forced to sell assets to raise even more capital at precisely the wrong time. It's not a massive amount, but you're starting to see assets for sale, loans for sale. It's tough. You can't do a good job for shareholders raising capital with huge discounts for some assets.

And she has come to some surprising conclusions.

So you're British, and you're ticked off that the mayor of London, currently up for re-election, is refusing to debate opponents. How do you express your distaste with this? Why, you dress in a chicken suit and chase a mayor lookalike around town. And you make it clear that this will keep happening until the mayor caves.

Hey, Ted: Flynn must be thoroughly evaluated. Here's what I don't like about him: 1. His size and arm strength are not much different from McCoy's. 2. I'm not sure how much he can lift a mediocre team -- a requirement of a true franchise quarterback. I believe his surrounding cast has lifted him. 3.

These concerns don't disqualify him, in my opinion, but allaying them would take a lot of research. I do agree if the Browns could find their quarterback outside the draft, they could really make some hay in the draft developing a supporting cast.

This newish Old Town venture is an ode to simple street dishes from all over Asia. The 500-year fusion of Portuguese and Chinese cultures on the island of Macau finds ecstatic expression in serradura ($6), the Portuguese word for "sawdust." Served in a small soup bowl, the dish begins with a base of cream and sweetened condensed milk whipped together into a surprisingly light pudding. Cocoa powder is dusted on top, and atop that comes a generous layer of the "sawdust" -- pulverized English-style tea biscuits. It's fattening and fabulous.

The very small particles that we're concerned about in terms of your health are much smaller and typically cannot be seen by the naked eye, but you can see them under a microscope. We talk about them in terms of micrometers in size, or a millionth of a meter. They are typically discussed in the context of what you can breathe or inhale. There are particles of less than 10 microns in size and diameter (PM10), which are inhalable. But those are considered coarse and pretty big particles in terms of what you can breathe in.

For the Mars crowd, that means real people in real relationships, real raunchy, real funny. Thank you, Kristen Wiig for every single one of those old-school Rs. In fact, so unusual is this sort of humor in testosterone-driven ha-ha-Hollywood these days, it almost makes me ha-ha-happy that producer Judd Apatow is currently the industry-anointed 800-pound clown prince, since it probably took all 800 pounds of his princely powers to get this film made. (R-rated female-centric, gal-pal entertainments don't exactly top studio wish lists.)

Like an 8.0 earthquake along the San Andreas Fault. Wizarding World altered the competitive Orlando marketplace, cutting into attendance at virtually every rival park and forcing Disney to unveil two massive counterattacks: a reinvention of Fantasyland for 2012 and the creation of Avatar Land for 2016. Expect the Boy Wizard to steal second-day visitors away from Disney California Adventure and force Mickey Mouse to respond with some new magic of his own.

So sommeliers particularly have become champions of more - and more accurate - alcohol disclosure. Perhaps that's because diners have only their own assumptions to rely on when browsing a wine list. Perhaps it's because wine directors have to pair wines with food - there's a reason one Australian winemaker dubbed high-octane specimens "cocktail wines" - or because they want their customers to walk out the door, not stagger.
Dear Ben: There is great feedback here, but you will need to take the initiative. You want your daughter to be competent in the world and have options. It’s as silly to not teach your kid how to drive as it is to not teach them how to swim. Push kindly — but firmly. Make it a fact-of-life requirement. Be sure to enroll her in a full-service course that includes in-class and on-road training. These classes create safer drivers than the do-it-yourself method many use after turning 18. The crash rate for 18-year-olds is way up due to this.

"We are the students of Sacred Heart High School. We feel our school has been closed unfairly. We were just blindsided by the news; we recieved this morning. In the middle of class, we were called to the gym and made to wait for fifteen minutes to find out what was going to happen. This would not have been as surprising if we had some kind of warning. However, we were outright told, in simple term(s), "The bishop has decided to close your school. Find somewhere else to go." This news came three days before midterms. Right in the middle of one of our most successuful sports seasons. Right before one of our most popular events, the Snowball (dance). Our students are devastated by this news, and we are trying to fight. We plead with you to help us. Our school is not just a school; it is a family. Our students are extremely close. We support each other in everything. We are always there for one another. This news has hurt us, but we are not broken. We refuse to go down without a fight. We love our school, and we don't want to go anywhere else. This school is our home. We love this school and will do anything it takes to reverse this decision."

But I surely left the candles smoldering, their wax, still-malleable globs sinking down in the frosting as though trapped in cream-cheese quicksand as I sped out the door at the stroke of age 16, heading to the Sunnyvale DMV with my mom in tow. It was there I would take my driving test in one of the most attractive motorcars ever to grace American asphalt -- our four-door Plymouth Volare, the color of a jaundiced flesh-tone crayon with the aerodynamic lines of a brick.
Whether Grassley and his staff would be satisfied with their response, they were left to wonder. As one official put it, "Whether or not they buy in, you are the man for supporting us like that."

The fast-paced Nuggets hope to scurry as much as possible against the more half-court-oriented Lakers to generate transition baskets.

A Russian source recently brought an obscure but disturbing article to my attention. Published last month by a little-known online journal called the Oriental Review, the piece, "Active Endeavour And Drug Trafficking," proposed that not a single gram of heroin has been confiscated on the Mediterranean Sea since the inception of NATO's Operation Active Endeavour, a maritime operation launched a month after the Sept. 11 attacks with the mission of "monitoring shipping to help detect, deter and protect against terrorist activity."

I was born in Tokyo in 1971, to my Japanese mother and American father. We relocated from Japan to the United States in 1978, settling eventually near Cleveland. From 1983 until 1990, my father worked at the Perry nuclear power plant, as an employee of the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. As that lyrical name suggests, it was the cheerful height of the nuclear age. In seventh grade, at Madison Middle School, I wrote my paper about the advantages of nuclear power. "It's safe, clean and efficient," I wrote down. We lived seven miles from the plant and on a clear day, we could see the steam plumes billowing white and soft above the cooling towers from our suburban block.

But it's a slight piece, a pale shadow of the hilarity-with-teeth of Epp and Dominique Serrand's Theatre de la Jeune Lune version of Molière's "The Miser" at the Rep six years ago. The satire has less bite. The action seems self-contained in a way that only fitfully connects with the audience. It's a lesser play.

6. Less than a week after Carpenter announced his support for teammate Wainwright as this year's Cy Young Award winner, Tim Lincecum -- the third wheel in the derby and an equally deserving candidate for the award -- said he thinks Carpenter deserves the award. A case can be made for each of the three pitchers, depending on what you value. The stats support whatever pitcher who want to win. Bend them, shape them, anyway you want them.

There's a tendency to judge one period of time as preferable to another. I think it works more this way: Changing part of any system sends ripples through that system. B.C.

During the offseason, Cardinals assistant hitting coach John Mabry went with his kids to see "Moneyball," a movie about a team that he played a supporting role in. The film, which follows the 2002 Oakland Athletics and GM Billy Beane's expanded use of statistics, is up for the Academy Awards' best picture Sunday. Mabry, who is played by David Hutchinson in the movie, said that the team wasn't "test-tube babies" for the statistical revolution as portrayed by Hollywood and that any retelling falls short when it minimizes the role of the team's top three pitchers, Tim Hudson, Barry Zito and Mark Mulder.

• Huskies ready to face Pac-12's new foes -- Percy Allen, Seattle Times: It's no secret football drove Scott's decision to expand the conference for the first time in three decades, but the league's 0-12 showing against ranked basketball teams magnifies the curious choice to extend invitations to schools that have been weak on the hard court recently. But it's not as if Colorado is embarrassing the Pac-12 this season. The Buffaloes are 9-4 and 1-0 in conference. Still, a closer examination of their record reveals CU has benefited from a soft schedule that ranks 243rd among the 345 Division I teams, according to the Pomeroy ratings.

Does that mean obesity has plateaued? Well, some larger CDC databases show continued upticks, said Duke University health economist Eric Finkelstein, who led the new CDC-funded forecast. His study used that information along with other factors that influence obesity rates — including food prices, prevalence of fast-food restaurants, unemployment — to come up with what he called "very reasonable estimates" for the next two decades.

As U.S. pop continues its march into the belly of the mainframe, the Brits are headed in the opposite direction. In the past three years, singers such as Adele, Florence Welsh, Duffy and Lauren Pritchard have been chasing a brassy throwback sound that owes more to Ray Charles and Dusty Springfield than Madonna and Michael Jackson. (Much of this has been a transparent attempt to come up with a sustainable alternative to Amy Winehouse.) It’s every bit as deliberate and constructed as the digital sound of our homegrown electropop androids, but the target is an imaginary past rather than an imaginary future.

Lisa Olson, FanHouse: "How can anyone with a conscience ever again hire Williams in any capacity? He shouldn't be allowed near the water bottles, never mind humans who prefer their body parts kept relatively intact. Make no mistake, for every Frank Gore's head or Michael Crabtree's leg, there are other craniums and ACLs on which Williams drew specific bull's-eyes. . . . Just as Payton and pals were meeting at league headquarters with Goodell, there dropped with a thud the smoking tape made by a documentary filmmaker who followed the Saints last season. On it Williams, then the Saints defensive coordinator who has been suspended indefinitely as part of the larger inquiry, is heard imploring his players to maim specific opponents by targeting specific body parts. He did this AFTER the league had told the Saints they were being investigated for engaging in illegal pay-to-injure schemes, proving Williams' hubris stretches beyond what we thought was just a normal King of the World conceit."

How does this revelation affect the 2011 field? Eminem is the oldest nominee, and he’s definitely male. He fits the profile of an Album of the Year winner — he’s been kicking around the Grammy lists since “The Slim Shady LP” won Best Rap Album in ‘99. At 24, Lady Gaga is the youngest in the field. But she’s not exactly an ingenue — she’s a known quantity. Morissette came out of nowhere, or Canada; Gaga feels like she’s been on magazine covers forever. The “Bad Romance” singer gets the 10 points, but a little grudgingly.

For all the trouble that Baltimore Racing Development is in now, the race was at a basic level a positive event for the city. Some 160,000 people attended over three days during Labor Day weekend. The course was exciting and beautiful, and locals and out-of-town visitors alike had a good time. It produced a $47 million economic impact for the city — a far cry from what race organizers promised, but still not an insignificant amount. Repairs to the streets downtown before the race were a huge headache for commuters, but the race itself produced less chaos than many feared.

Bruce made a long toss of the guitar and tech Kevin Buell may have made his best catch ever. The guitar sailed far to the side on a long toss and Kevin had to really hustle to catch it. When he did, even Bruce stopped and clapped for him. "The wind took it!" Bruce joked about his bad throw.
The concern, perhaps, will be whether the league looks at Clarkson's charging penakty against Brandon Dubinsky at 19:27 of the second period. The Devils' right winger left his feet.

Adding insult to injury, the Knicks fans began to jeer the Wizards in the fourth quarter. The Wizards didn't score a field goal in the final quarter until 6:43 left in the game, and the crowd began chanting the Wizards score.

When we moved into our house, it had an above-ground pool and every spring, frogs would lay egg masses in the water on the cover. I'd recruit my husband and we'd carefully net the gelatinous eggs and painstakingly walk them down a steep hill to a manmade pond, where we'd deposit them. I thought I was helping oodles of future frogs by righting a bad decision their parents had made in egg-laying.

Police searched the vehicle and found prescriptions drugs under the driver’s seat. The driver was arrested on the outstanding warrant and was cited for driving under suspension, unsafe motor vehicle and possession of a controlled substance.

Heat the 1/3 cup olive oil over moderate heat in a large, wide, deep skillet or Dutch oven, preferably nonstick or enameled cast iron. It must be large enough to hold all the vegetables with the fish on top. Add the onion, fennel and potatoes. Season highly with salt and pepper and stir well. Saute, stirring often, until the potatoes are almost tender but not browned, about 20 minutes. Reduce the heat if necessary. Add the wine/saffron mixture, chickpeas, cilantro and 1 cup water. Put the tomatoes in a bowl and crush them well with your hands, then add them. Cover and cook at a gentle simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Put the fish on top of the bed of vegetables, cover and cook just until the fillets are white throughout and flake when probed with a fork, about 10 minutes.

Cala ($3.99/pound) had similar issues. With "veggies cut too fine," the coleslaw "seemed to wilt with dressing" and was "not too fresh-looking." But it had a "traditional coleslaw flavor" and a "nice tang with lots of celery seed." Three might buy this brand and two would not.
The scanners will help for now, but it's only a matter of time before a terrorist comes up with a way to get around them. A cheaper and more effective alternative exists -- smart screening. And smart screening doesn't take naked pictures of everyone trying to board a plane.
Stocks climbed on reports that business at the nation's services companies grew in May and that the number of people seeking first-time jobless claims slipped for a second week.

Let's start with the dining credit: You could be conservative and squeeze out two meals or splurge on a special Titanic Tea for two ($47 per person, 1-3 p.m. May 12). The free cocktails usually cost $12-$15 each, and the free Titanic tickets usually cost $27 each. So provided you spend down the credit and take advantage of the extras, the room cost comes out to about $121 plus tax a night.
If there's any regulation, it's Big Green's fault.
Census Director Robert Groves opposes the proposal and recently told lawmakers that it would greatly delay the decennial count.
TOYOTA TROUBLES: Bad publicity from the recalls, mainly for cars that can accelerate without warning, was hurting Toyota long before the earthquake. The recalls began late in 2009, and came just as GM, Ford, Hyundai, and others introduced more competitive cars and trucks. With a bunch of nice alternatives and doubts about quality, customers who dutifully returned to Toyota started considering other brands. Many Toyota models look old and need upgrades. Despite rebates and low-interest financing, Toyota was the only major automaker with lower U.S. sales last year. Sales are up 12.5 percent so far in 2011, but only at half the growth of GM.
There was the Revolution Museum, which includes everything from Castro's boots to the typewriter of a New York Times reporter who covered the conflict. The museum also displays pieces of an American B-26 shot down in 1961 and a turbine from a U-2 spy plane shot down during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 – somewhat uncomfortable for Americans.
In their first nine games, the Indians hit 16 homers. They haven't hit one in the past 10. It's their longest homerless streak in almost 30 years. They went 14 games without a homer in 1983 from Aug. 10 through Aug. 27.

The Zambrano saga already has enough chapters to fill a book, which would then be made into a Quentin Tarantino movie. He tried the patience of three managers, all of whom defended his boorish behavior at first, only to get kicked in the gut by his lack of respect for authority. The general manager who handed Zambrano a $91.5 million contract didn't even get a phone call when he decided to "retire" after walking out on the team in Atlanta last August.
Erin Runnion is passionate in her support. She thinks Carona has been victimized by Haidl, and his other former assistant sheriff, George Jaramillo. Both men worked with the government in its case against Carona.
From time to time, he would visit home and go out painting in the Delta. As time went on, he became increasingly aware of agricultural machines, some antiquated, some in disrepair, that stood like "sculptural sentinels" on the landscape, as if the sculptor David Smith had visited the Delta and left some of his works behind.

In 1986, for example, an Indians vs. Boston Red Sox game was postponed due to a massive fog bank that rolled in off the lake. Which prompted Red Sox pitcher Oil Can Boyd to remark: “That’s what they get for building a park on the ocean.”
"Your fans boo you, for good reason, for the right reason, it was starting to get ugly," Guillen said. "Hopefully we play better tomorrow than we did today, because my wife has very bad insurance. I've got to make sure I put my money in my insurance because if we keep playing like that, I might not make it to July."
NEW YORK - The shuttle needs some space.
It might be useful to take a step back in understanding that the site of the Battle of Princeton counterattack was envisioned from the beginning to be a vital part of Princeton Battlefield State Park. In 1944, C.S. Sincerbeaux prepared a map showing Washington’s counterattack on what is now the proposed faculty housing site. This map became the basis for Gov. Walter Edge’s park boundary lines. The Institute for Advanced Study received a copy of the map and indicated that it was favorably disposed to working with the governor in putting the park together. Then, in 1945, the institute purchased 129.99 acres from Robert Maxwell, including the site of the counterattack — a site that Gov. Edge passionately wanted to be in the park. In 1947, Mr. Maxell and Mrs. Agnes Pyne Hudson both gave property to the park; other parcels were purchased, some acquired under the threat of eminent domain.

We built a lot of systems then in risk management, so we already knew how to turn the switch and employ practices. In the recent financial crisis, we started watching our cash on a daily basis. Newer people would not know what to do because they'd never experienced anything like these events.
The president has already supported a number of initiatives backed by gays, including an end to the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy, and a decision not to defend in court a federal law that was designed as an alternative to gay marriage.
"I've never had four goals ... I don't think so," he said, after running his three-game total to six goals. "(Ty) Rattie did it last series and it was pretty impressive. Just to do it myself is pretty nice."

"I immediately sensed the disparity between their dreams and reality," said Upadhye, who was trained in architecture in his native India. "I believe in doing a lot of churning and grinding in terms of the thought process. A lot of excessive things fall off."
Michael Johnson, head honcho at Herbalife, had the biggest payday of the companies surveyed in the latest report. He was paid more than $89.4 million last year as CEO of the nutritional direct-marketing company.
The biggest cheer after Alomar popped out of the dugout went to Browns president Mike Holmgren, who was sitting behind the Indians dugout and popped up, larger than life, on the Jumbotron in the middle of the fifth inning. Facing their own eternal rebuilding, the Browns might find the cheers last only until fans see quarterback question marks Jake Delhomme or Seneca Wallace throw a pass.
"When you make minor changes in the educational program, you may see a slight increase in student achievement, but it only lasts a couple years," he said. "What we're trying to show is dramatic change and lasting change."
Mother's Day is the perfect time to pause and celebrate not only our mothers but also the generosity of our community and how the Pacifica Resource Center helps spread that generosity to those that need it most. Now is the perfect time to reflect on the sobering fact that one in ten Pacificans earns less than $25,000 a year, and 1 in 4 Pacificans are eligible for — but in many cases do not receive — public and private benefits, such as CalFresh (California's food stamp program), utility assistance, and housing or child care subsidies.

I'm puzzled. Why might that be? Quick English lesson: You don't spell this legal practice "p-e-r-k," you spell it "g-r-a-f-t."
The city's annexation plans are a bad deal for Seminole County residents, who are happy with county services, and for Casselberry residents, who will forgo the subsidy the water surcharge provides. Along with the new ordinances, these annexation plans are just another example of the city's heavy-handed attempts to make unnecessary changes to the character of a city whose hard-working residents deserve the right to define their own community.
The Games are held once every two years. Organizers say this year’s theme is twofold - remembering the victims of the 9/11 attacks and thanking people the world over for the outpouring of empathy and support following the attacks.

Hi, my name is Dean and I’m a 6 year old border collie. I was a hard working farm dog until March of 2010 when I decided to retire from the herding business and move to Baltimore. But I've found retirement hard to settle into. I can't relax! I need a job! I play in the park as if it's my career. I never let a ball out of my sight. I'll toss a stick until I'm literally bleeding. Play is my work. And The Perfect Dog Toy was able to keep up with me.

For Joe Williams, their major concern is to generate support for the idea as the Southwest Council reaches out to its members for anything from letters supporting the new center to advice on what services it should offer. According to Williams, they’ve been getting support from former clients as well as members of the community for their new project and that while “the competition is certainly steep,” that their experience of working in Gloucester County for over 20 years will put their proposal over the top.
With a laugh he added, "I don't know if (a contract year) is good or bad."
The OHSU scientists plan to inject the stem cells into as many as six children, ages 2 to 12, suffering from one of two forms of Batten disease. These genetic diseases, which hit perhaps three of every 100,000 U.S. children, are caused by low levels of enzymes that break down granules of fat and protein. Without the enzyme, the granules build up in the brain and cause ever more damage until death.
"I'm opposed to the budget as it currently stands, but I'm hopeful we can solve this and keep the bureau at full strength," he said.
Booker also noted that despite putting up the bulk of the money to build the arena, the city has no seats for big events.

Perhaps the most fascinating and inventive of the 14 pieces on the program (the project is planned to ultimately run to 36 commissions) was "I Think About You," Paul Moravec's broad and emotionally turbulent treatment of "Losing My Mind" from "Follies." The piece begins simply enough, but quickly balloons into a ferocious outburst of thunderous pounding, and the final recap of the song - done in pure, limpid harmonies - is all the more effective in the wake of that emotional turbulence.
Several websites have reported that Solvang, which has hosted a Tour of California time trial four times, did not submit a 2012 hosting bid.
Lasting a career-long 4-1/3 innings, Smith kept the Seminoles around just long enough to help fuel their comeback bid. With a career-high four strikeouts, Smith didn't allow a run during his 50-pitch outing.

Coach Kermit Davis agreed to a five-year contract extension with Middle Tennessee that runs through the 2016-17 season. Athletic Director Chris Massaro announced the deal, saying continuity is the best way for the Blue Raiders to accomplish their goals. Davis took the Blue Raiders to a school-record 27 victories this season and was the Sun Belt Conference coach of the year. The Blue Raiders lost to Minnesota in the National Invitation Tournament in the quarterfinals after a big victory at Tennessee. Davis now is Middle Tennessee's winningest coach after 10 seasons. Counting this spring, the last 23 players to finish their eligibility under Davis will graduate from Middle Tennessee.
After the broadcast resumed seconds later, the crestfallen look on Couric's face was startling; it at once told viewers that something catastrophic was under way, even though it was too early to understand the enormity.

Hey, Tony: Holmgrem, Heckert and Shurmur all have the same agent (Bob LaMonte). Does he represent any key free agents that the Browns might take a look at? Is it normal in the NFL for an agent to have so much influence on one team? -- Robby Whitmyer, Louisville, Ohio

The 1859 courthouse stands stalwart, the inside given over to a few old photos, a gallery space and a souvenir shop. The Pioneer Inn, founded in 1901, is still in business (now affiliated with the Best Western brand), still facing the harbor from Wharf Street. But it's tired. I'm not usually one to beg for price hikes, but one day, I hope, somebody will spend some money, raise the rates and dress up that droopy place.

Mexico lures many with its legal drinking age of 18, rather than the usual 21 in the U.S. And tour operators and resort companies woo students by assembling packages that bundle airfare, lodging, meals, access to "VIP" rooms and often drinks as well. Wander into any spring-break zone and you'll find that even the most scantily clad celebrants are sporting color-coded plastic bracelets to affirm their party privileges. (And even if spring-breakers don't buy a tour operator's package, in Mexico they're likely to find clubs that charge $25 to $35 for admission, then serve beer at no charge.)

Annie is as engaging as she is generous, full of opinions earned by living life at full throttle, even when she was scared to death. And that is a crucial truth about Annie Glenn. Americans rightly "ooh" and "ahh" over John Glenn's courage in space, but let us never forget the hero of a wife who gave her public blessing, and then privately prayed until his safe return.

TAMPA — Cilantro is the most divisive herb. Some people can't even be in the same room with it, can detect a single quark of the green herb in a bathtub of salsa. Scientists think there is a gene that causes some people to perceive the flavor as unpleasantly "soapy." Like fruitcake or gin, there's no middle ground (see ihatecilantro.com).

The problem with being Justin Bieber is that eventually you’ve got to grow up. All of those kids who went crazy for "Baby" and "U Smile" in 2010 are two years older and more discerning; eventually, they’ll be down at the college radio station spinning Wild Flag and Beach House, aggressively disowning their preteen folly. How does an artist who specializes in anodyne professions of puppy love stay relevant as his fan base ages along with him? Has the time come for Justin Bieber to get sexy?

Like "The Lord of the Rings," C.S. Lewis' "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" was the product of a Great Britain that had just been through a war of survival. The story neither was about World War II, nor was it an allegory for it, and yet it was informed by the moral absolutes and challenges of the wartime period: There's the presence of darkest evil, which can't be avoided but must be faced head-on. There's the grim understanding that sacrifice is necessary, that whole worlds are riding on the actions of a handful of individuals. And, in the presence of a wickedness so complete as to be supernatural, there's faith in absolute goodness.
You aren't going to see a lot of 1,000 yard receivers at Oregon, no matter how long Chip stays because throwing the ball is a change of pace play in this offense. The main problem with the receiver corp last year was drops and the lack of an explosive downfield threat. If even one of our 4 star redshirts emerges, both of those problems should be solved.

With West Virginia out of the picture (and the Scarlet Knight’s 17 game losing streak to them), Rutgers and Louisville will most likely be the media favorites. Rutgers will get Louisville at home and essentially replaces a trip to Morgantown with a trip to Philadelphia to play Temple - where as the road team Scarlet Knight fans could equal and perhaps outnumber Owl fans. This is not to say this schedule is not without its speed bumps. South Florida is notorious for playing well in September, having knocked off the likes of Florida State and Notre Dame in recent years only to take a swan dive in the latter months of the season. Rutgers has not won in Cincinnati in three tries during Big East play. Couple this with back-to-back road trips with Pittsburgh following the Cincinnati game and the USF game will carry even more significance. Should Rutgers prevail in Tampa and knock off their two local rivals at home in Connecticut and Syracuse, they will give themselves a cushion against the Bearcats and Pittsburgh should they lose to one of those two. Providing USF doesn’t win out after the early loss to the Scarlet Knights, even with one conference loss for Rutgers the Cardinals would have no way of clinching before the Thursday night matchup.

3. Kudos to the Cardinals for making the quick decision to retire Tony La Russa's No. 10. Great manager, historically prominent manager, an obvious move. One thing that intrigues me though: I think that Billy Southworth has to be one of the most (if not the most) overlooked figures in Cardinals history. He managed the Cardinals for 6+ seasons. He went 620-346 for an astounding winning percentage of .642. The Cardinals won the World Series in 1942 and 1944 with Southworth as manager, and the 1943 team won 105 games and the NL pennant. No, Southworth's career as manager was relatively short, but he led an amazing run for the franchise. In a pleasant surprise, the Veterans Committee honored Southworth by voting him into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008. I believe the Cardinals should do more to recognize Southworth's prominent role in one of the most illustrious eras in franchise history.
Concussion is a medical condition about which there is a lot of misinformation. Many parents believe your child must be a star athlete to experience a concussion.

debt levels, Dave said "cost cuts aren't necessarily tied to de-levering," (i.e. reducing debt) noting many are just "good business" and "common sense." Pointed to recent trip where he hit 4 cities in Tex over 2.5 day period, flying Southwest, for 10% of what it would have cost to "use our jet."

Personal story: "At the beginning of my junior year, I sustained a major knee injury requiring surgery. I missed my entire junior football season.

The van rammed the officers' parked car, pushing it into a Dumpster.
"She never had a break from reality," said Birkett, who is now a state appellate judge. "She knew what she was doing. She had a full appreciation of her conduct. It was a combination of depression, revenge and guilt over what she had done to her marriage even before she had killed her children."

PLANTING: My Stropharia always produced best in sun or broken shade with well-drained, moist soil. Mushroom mycelium needs to be mixed with fresh hardwood chips or sawdust.

And that was Tapp; imagine if DE Trent Cole was in there. That would have been a huge problem for Hairston. So this weekend, Umenyiora could create massive problems for the Bills. And I mean big-time problems. The way he's been moving and getting off the line, he figures to give Hairston fits.
Role model: "My band director, Mr. Smelser, is my role model. He is unbelievably dedicated and amazing at everything he does.

He has inspired me to be the musician I am today, and has shown me how dedication really pays off."

* What the hell is Mike Holmgren talking about? The Cleveland Browns' president certainly seemed to be trying to cover his backside Wednesday during a conference call with team season-ticket holders. Holmgren implied that the Rams gave preferential treatment to the Washington Redskins in the deal that sent the rights to the No. 2 overall draft pick to D.C. The Redskins will use the pick on Baylor QB Robert Griffin III. The Browns apparently wanted Griffin, too, despite all of the pre-draft posturing coming out of Cleveland about the Browns being ambivalent about RG3.

Nua, the chic wine bar in North Beach, also has a new toque; the food's still good but doesn't quite hit the heights it did when I reviewed it. Cav, too, has a new chef, and the cooking is just as good, including what I think may be the best charcuterie plate in the city. However, I didn't include it in my list, because the wine bar/restaurant is actually a couple of years old.

Of course I have. I've been to Brussels, lifelong home of Tintin's creator, Georges Prosper Remi, better known by his comic book nom de plume, Hergé. Fans and scholars of the strip — a serious tribe known as Tintinologists — may recall an often-reproduced photo of Hergé, posed with a natty cane and bowler hat at the market on the Place du Jeu de Balle in the funky-chic Marolles district of Brussels, where collectors sell vintage postcards, dubious Old Master paintings, threadbare Oriental rugs, broken lamps and model ships just like the one Tintin finds at the opening of the film. On a Sunday morning, the Jeu de Balle flea market is one of my favorite places because of its Tintin connections.

I think Samardzija was just trying to be honest, and he subsequently admitted he talked a big game about being a starter and didn't want to "look like an idiot." I'd rather a player say something interesting than repeat the old company line of "whatever is best for the team." As far as hubris consultant, I believe that's part of the psychologist's job. And he's doing a great job, by the way.

Another provision that could affect all federal employees allows the Postal Service to set up its own employee health insurance plan and withdraw from the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.

øUnless the rules of capitalism are suspended, eventually, Apple will encounter a rival that's able to take it on. If that happens, using Apple stock as an ATM will cease to work. And that's why your strategy seems to be setting you up for trouble. Remember that Apple stock can correct, especially considering how rapidly it's risen. If there's any disruption in the company's business, a severe downturn in the stock would be expected. And that's why using the stock market for quick gains, traditionally, has not worked out well and is not a good idea.

These perceptual perks have real-world benefits. The scientists argue, for instance, that the ability to process vast amounts of data helps to explain the prevalence of savant-like talents among autistic subjects. Some savants perform difficult mathematical calculations in their head, others draw exquisitely detailed pictures at a young age.

Because they can process details that elude the rest of us, they can perform tasks that seem impossible, at least for the normal mind.

Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph worked their inside-out game to perfection on a night when Paul and Blake Griffin were limited by injuries and the Clippers' bench couldn't quite put them over the top.
In front of children, in professional settings and in polite company, most Americans no longer think it is OK to make racist jokes about black people. We recognize that it is both hurtful and inaccurate to judge someone's intentions by their skin color or ethnic origin. But when it comes to Muslims and people from Muslim countries, we lose those same sensibilities. So why do my kind, liberal-minded friends make such comments without realizing the offense they're causing?

Ward 3 Councilman Ronald Ely contradicted Matyja on a number of points. Ely admitted, "the city will pay for infrastructure improvements," though he added that such changes "will need to be done eventually anyway."

As the couple works through their issues, Tom and Violet aren't the only ones who are conflicted. At times the film plays like farce — a painful crossbow misfire, an improbable parkour action scene in an Ann Arbor alleyway. At other times, such as when Tom's discontent surfaces, the film shifts to relationship drama in ways that are interesting yet out of sync with the general tone. Cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe ("Vicky Cristina Barcelona") must have had to scramble to keep up with the mood changes and the one-off comic bits that keep turning up.

Baffert has earned a reputation for pushing his horses and building to the six-week Triple Crown chase, which has not been successfully navigated since Affirmed did it in 1978.

3. Ocean's Eleven (2001): High on the list of those few remakes that are superior to the original. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Andy Garcia and Carl Reiner are perfect casts, and are admirably guided through a taut, clever plan to heist multi-millions from Vegas casinos. So much better than the "Rat Pack" original. It's too bad the two sequels stunk up the joint.

A: I still people think people don't drink enough rosé - they still have the White Zin relationship in their head. There are three reasons, really, that people don't drink it: One, they are afraid they won't know what to order; two, there are a lot of really bad ones out there because any winery makes a rosé now.

Mulally's comments weren't offered as a criticism of Romney. Rather, he was defending Ford's decision to go to Congress with GM and Chrysler in 2008 to call for a federal rescue.

DG: Whiting received some consideration for the club's Pitcher of the Year Award within in the Cardinals' front office. He started the year in the bullpen but emerged to be the most consistent starter for Low-A Quad Cities. Was the best prospect in that rotation? No, Carlos Martinez was to start the year and Trevor Rosenthal was to finish it. But you could call Whiting the ace of the group. He is the latest control pitcher to succeed at that level, following P.J. Walters and Trey Hearne, to name two. Folks I've spoken to believe Whiting's stuff is a tick better, and that will have to be true for him to ascend. Boone has command of three pitches, he operates in that 88-91 mph area, and he has what's advertised as a true swing-and-miss slider. That last trait will serve him well as he advances, and it does feed the notion that relief work could be in his future. Right now, he'll stay as a starter because of his mix of pitches and his ability to fit them into the edges of the strike zone. It makes sense for him to be on the same "track" as the pitchers he echoes - a steady climb through the system. Hearne had trouble in Class AA. Walters and his changeup had difficulty in the majors. Like those two, Whiting will have to master the level before moving ahead, and his first test will come in Springfield, when he gets there.

While Americans have "proved time and again that they see a politician's cheating in marriage as tantamount to cheating on the voters and the country," the French "do not enjoy ugly revelations that disturb the surface and threaten the social fabric," Sciolino writes. In fact, male politicians are expected to exude virility as proof that they are able to handle the job.

Mr. Cain's allegation that the Perry camp was responsible for stirring up this latest political hornet's nest is only likely to increase pressure on him to be more forthcoming about the details of the case in which his employer paid a settlement to the accuser.

Minutes later, Uddin pulled her car onto the side of Hwy 52. Video shows his next frantic two minutes as he grabs at several passing cars in the northbound lane, then hops the median, running in front of four oncoming cars before stepping in front of the slowing semi. Uddin then jumps back into the center lane, where a van, swerving to try not to hit him, knocks him 50 feet. He broke several ribs and his right shoulder.

PSA: There are fans of AirCal and Western Air Lines and others in Southern California. But I took my first solo plane trip on PSA in the 1960s and planes with smiley faces, as well as flight attendants in hot pants and boots, make quite an impression on a 14-year-old boy.

Our endorsement comes after discussions with city officials and finance experts who assured us this was no back-door scheme to privatize city assets. They also convinced us that many potential trust deals - such as retrofitting buildings to be more energy efficient - probably couldn't be done with traditional public financing. In many instances, the city still will use traditional municipal bonds, but privately financed deals open up a new world of capital. Though they potentially feature higher interest rates, they bring efficiencies and better allocation of risk that could drive down costs.

But today, none of the candidates seems completely prepared to grapple with what to do next. Some repeat falsehoods as if they were gospel: Los Angeles County's jails are overcrowded (false; they are at about half capacity). California's recidivism rate is 70% (meaningless, without distinguishing between a new criminal offense that should land an offender back behind bars and a technical parole violation, such as failing to report to an agent in time). Realignment puts parolees on our streets unsupervised (a blatant falsehood). State prisoners are being released early under realignment (false). But it's true that if prosecutors, the courts and the sheriff are not careful, they will release people whom they should keep. And it's true that under realignment, more jail inmates (as opposed to prison inmates) may be unsupervised upon release.

I often bracket my trips to Hawaii with a stay in the Honolulu area on the way in and out. Arriving in Hawaii, I like the Moana Surfrider, The Breakers or the Outrigger Reef to jump right into the ocean and enjoy a little nightlife.

The lower production and distribution costs also allow fashion houses to be more daring and experimental in their efforts. Marni's video for the 2010 Summer collection, released in January in collaboration with video artist Rohan Wadham, is a two-minute stop-motion vignette starring two almond-eyed white dolls. Prada's "First Spring," by artist Yang Fudong, is an esoteric, noirish nine-minute black-and-white film in which no one speaks a word.
This month, however, crude has largely moved sideways, as oil buyers adjusted to Iranian sanctions and turned back to a middling economic outlook.

But I learned a few years back that UCLA did a preservation (on the original materials) so a better-than-decent print now exists."

There is talk of George Eastman; there is talk of the other photographers who rushed to the scene, and what they did, and yadda yadda. God knows, I love dead unknown photographers as much as the next guy, but the San Francisco Earthquake and Fire of 1906 was not about photography. It was about about the largest city on the Pacific Coast brought to its knees. So the show isn't about photographs, whatever the curator thinks; it's about the content of the photographs.

By the time we ate the second cheese, the rind was a burnt orange with black spots, which the book said was fine — it's only if you start to see blue spots that the cheese is spoiling.

For a light roux, the oil and flour are cooked for less time, meaning the mix develops less color and flavor but has increased thickening power. The flavors of the meat and stewed vegetables were good enough that I might argue that an entree-sized bowl is reasonable at $15, but the small cup we tried seemed overpriced at $8.
"Our No. 1 priority before was just finding classroom space for these kids," she said, "and other things just fell by the wayside."

It was a small sample size, and that was good, because that’s what Stephenson’s senior season consisted of. He broke a big toe in the season’s third game, ending his season. Some of the region’s finest football schools offered scholarships to Stephenson anyway. His ceiling was that high.
BPA Administrator Steve Wright is still reviewing a controversial plan to occasionally "curtail" wind farms in the region, a move the federal power-marketing agency has said is necessary to maintain grid reliability, protect migrating salmon and avoid passing big costs onto its public utility customers.

Two flight attendants reported dizziness and four passengers fainted aboard an American Airlines flight Friday, forcing the pilot to drop the jet's oxygen masks and land in Ohio, an airline spokesman said.
Critics say hospitals are underreporting and that puts patients in harm's way. As long ago as 1996, a government agency concluded that the number of hospital reports was "unreasonably low." It has gotten even lower. In 2008, the number of reports was three-fourths of the 1996 total, according to the newspaper's analysis.
Junior forward Cory Kettler returns after logging 21 goals, 11 assists and four hat tricks. He already has six goals and four assists through five games as Holt entered Monday's game against Howell with a record of 4-1. Kettler is joined on the top line by junior Austin Flynn.

Subsequent San Francisco building code overhauls in 1939, 1956, 1975, 1984, 1990 and 1992 greatly advanced building and fire safety. And even though a San Francisco program mandated strengthening of unreinforced masonry, or URM, buildings in 1986, which has worked through about 90 percent of the city's nearly 2,000 brick buildings, legacies of the 1906 quake and fire remain. There are still thousands of hastily rebuilt unreinforced masonry buildings cheek-by-jowl with wooden structures with no fire-resistant walls between them.
"It's too emotional," he says. "When people bring in a deer, they're happy. If they brought in a pet, they'd be crying and upset."
But if he changes his mind, the Tribune found there is another path to justice: A little-known provision of Mexico's penal code known as Article 4 allows Mexican authorities to prosecute their own citizens for crimes committed in the U.S. or on foreign soil. Though born and raised in the U.S., Castillo is a naturalized Mexican because his parents were born in that country.

"Anybody who has invested here is rooting for them," says Gwenn Marie, president of the Chamber of Commerce.
Our budget situation is not a Beaverton problem; it is an Oregon problem. Districts throughout the state have been faced with similar budget challenges. Beaverton has reduced budgets by $105 million, largely sparing schools from deep cuts. We have used the ending fund balance and other one-time savings, negotiated employee concessions, reduced infrastructure and central office personnel, and minimally reduced the workforce through staff attrition to balance the budget. Many of these past options are no longer available.
Meanwhile, officials report that water levels on Willow Grove Lake are significantly down after fears that the dam there would fail following Hurricane Irene.
Tedesco's plight underlies the difficulties that the makers of music documentaries increasingly face. As the recording industry has seen its sales tumble by more than half since 2000, labels are intent on squeezing every bit of profit out of songs in their catalogs. Licensing that music to films -- whether big Hollywood productions or modestly budgeted documentaries -- is an attractive source of revenue.
NOTE: If you'd like to make your own liqueur, soak 1 cup of food-safe flowers (such as honeysuckle, violets, roses and elderflowers) or 1/2 cup lavender petals in one 750-ml bottle of vodka or neutral-grain alcohol. Let it sit for 7 to 10 days, then strain. Add up to 1/2 cup sugar (to taste); stir until dissolved. For a nonalcoholic version, simmer lavender petals in a simple syrup (see recipe for L'Enfant Lemonade).

Over the last three years, members of the environmental community, including the four groups endorsing Obama, have had an often contentious relationship with the administration. They have praised what they consider important steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to boost cleaner air and water, such as rules to hike vehicle fuel efficiency and to curtail mercury emissions from power plants. But they have slammed the administration for inaction in other areas, such as its decision last year to halt the development of a long-awaited rule to reduce smog.

Rival games and the postseason are a bad mix if you're not prepared. Good teams have bad days and get sent home every year. While the district field isn't as loaded as some others, Walsh knows that on any given night your season will end. He feels the schedule his team has played will help it when it takes the court next Wednesday in the district semifinals against either Lindbergh or Mehlville.
Meanwhile, the yield on the country's 10-year bond remained near the dangerously high level of 6 percent. Yields are a direct measure of investor wariness of a country's finances. Rates of above 7 percent are seen as unsustainable in the long-run.

Serve: Fry calamari by cleaning 1 pound of squid and cutting into 1/2-inch rings. Dust with all-purpose flour and season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour enough oil into a large saucepan to reach a depth of 3 inches. Heat on medium-high, and when hot, carefully add squid in batches. Be careful not to overcrowd the pan. Fry until crisp, about 1 minute per batch. Use tongs or a slotted spoon to transfer calamari to paper-towel-lined plates to drain. Serve with lemon wedges.

It's a job that, so far this year, has included an investigation into a student's brutal off-campus beating. There was the boy who brought a pocketful of prescription pills to sell  even though they were non-narcotic drugs aimed at managing schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There was the call from a substitute teacher who reported a dice game in progress  on a science lab table. And there was a wall full of gang graffiti in a bathroom, which could have been the work of a real gang or maybe just some wannabes.

Rarin' to deal: As Belichick's point man in New England, Scott Pioli orchestrated numerous deals on draft day to stockpile future picks for the Patriots.

Berkman said he felt some bite in the calf since returning to the lineup Tuesday night against Cincinnati. On Wednesday, he extended his hitting streak to seven games to start this season with an infield single in the first inning. He raced to beat the play at first, and then he was involved in a double steal before finally sprinting around third to score on David Freese's double. Berkman said he knew there was still soreness in the leg in all that running, but it wasn't until the top of the fifth inning when soreness became injury.
How much “Story/Time” recycles Jones’ earlier works is unclear. The catch-me-I’m-falling group exercise appeared in “Blind Date;” and the story of Noah and the Flood was central to “Another Evening: I Bow Down.” Some overlapping partnering moves recall “Monkey Run Road,” and the whole evening seems to develop the concepts of Jones’ solo “As I Was Saying.” Yet “Story/Time” is not exactly a Cunningham “Event.”

Barrett, more than likely, was focused on freeing McCleave, but perhaps he also felt the weight of the nation's future. And perhaps this is why Barrett, an experienced officer, made the mistake that buoyed the sagging rebel forces in what many consider the westernmost battle of the war. His error was costly but not fatal to the Union. The same could not be said of him. He is still out here, buried, it's said, by Interstate 10, along with some of the most interesting and underappreciated history of the American Civil War.

Thanks, Harry. Suddenly, young people, who wouldn't spend much vacation time with their folks, much less get out of bed this early if they didn't have to, think family vacations are fun again, especially when mom and dad or grandpa pay for the trip and pop for $100 wizarding robes (yes, despite the 90-degree Florida heat, fans traipsed around the park in the floor-length robes, wearing Hogwarts ties as belts) or $30 wands.

Nothing really prepares you for your first glimpse of the Drynachan Valley, set within the vast Cawdor estate in the Scottish Highlands. Having driven across a near lunar landscape of desolate moorland, you turn a bend and drop down into a steep pine wood.

Nike was rolling out its new, overpriced, Third World-made status symbols, and for these sin-ugly psychedelic babies, at $220 plus tax, Nike again kept the prices ridiculously high and the supply extremely limited. Yet again, Nike would cause both a buzz and a feeding frenzy among those who would regard procurement of a pair of cheaply made sneakers as worthy of committing mayhem — and too many times even murder.
Coach Jerry York and star goalie Parker Milner know how hard it really is.
"Peter was in the right place at the right time," Redfearn said. "He's a calm man who doesn't get rattled."

Hitchcock was the ideal fit for a promising but enigmatic team. Including the five-game triumph over San Jose in the Western Conference quarterfinals, the Blues are 47-16-11 under Hitchcock. They've advanced to the second round for the first time since 2002.
As a fan favorite, Joel often draws cheers that are disproportionate to his actual productivity. Then again, he is a 7-footer who averaged 5.1 rebounds in 16 minutes last season - and that's not the easiest thing to find. Assuming Przybilla is available for the entire season, he would be an asset to Portland's roster if he comes off the bench. He doesn't cost much, won't complain about his minutes, and will enthusiastically perform inglorious duties like screen-setting and charge-taking.
The meeting was delayed more than an hour as members of the council debated who would sit in the front of the room. The committee was to consist of four councilmen and three residents so it could be held in closed session. Once it was determined that a closed meeting would violate open meetings laws, the remaining four members of the board joined the group for its first meeting last week.
Plain Dealer reviewer Nancy Connors observed that Carey, through his novels, has often shown interest "in the dispossessed, the traveler, the singular person caught up in troubles not entirely of his own making. But however askew, his characters also are observant and philosophical, which makes you want to go where they go, see what they see and hear what they have to say, however unreliable they may be" because "these characters have perhaps the most distinctive voices in current literature."

“Last November I was elected to the office of Mayor by an overwhelming majority. At that time I pledged to faithfully serve the people of Hamilton Township to the best of my ability. In spite of the recent allegations by the United States Attorney’s Office, nothing has changed. It is my intention to continue to perform the responsibilities of my office with the same abiding commitment that I have held in the past. While I am sensitive to all concerned, I am not resigning as your Mayor because I am innocent of these charges. It is also not my intention to litigate this case in the press, but rather, I will vigorously defend myself in Court when given the opportunity.

This is Lawson's team. As such he should be responsible for the Nuggets being ready to play rather than teammates wondering where Lawson disappeared.
And now there's even an app for doing our taxes. TurboTax for iPhone and Android not only lets you fill out the return, but uses the phone's camera to snap a photo of your W2s to record the data. And speaking of money, my camera-equipped smartphone has relieved me of the one reason I used to have to visit my local bank. Now, instead of driving to a branch, I use the bank's app to take a picture of checks that I'm sent and "phone in" my deposits.

The Florida Gators, with their campus just 70 miles away in Gainesville, practiced in Jacksonville on Tuesday. . . . Ohio State is staying in a hotel on the property of the TPC Sawgrass, a golf course that hosts a PGA Tour event and features the well-known island green on the 17th hole. Several players toured the course Tuesday, while a few took shuttles to the beach. . . . A team welcome dinner was held at the hotel, with most of the players wearing black golf shirts with an OSU logo. It brought to mind the attire glitch of two years ago when quarterback Terrelle Pryor and two other players were prevented by Jim Tressel from attending a dinner at a prime rib restaurant the week of the Rose Bowl because they were wearing jeans. Back then, that qualified as a Buckeye controversy.
Matheny was up at dawn, ready to go to work, in no mood to reflect, dawdle or otherwise waste time. It was perhaps the most important day of his baseball life, his first official game as a major-league manager. So he looked at video, read scouting reports, studied numbers.

His second show in 1961 featured a now-famous poster of Price casually riding a Pacific wave on his surfboard, arms held high with his name printed in a rainbow-arch between outstretched hands. It included small, sleek, brightly painted "eggs" with sexually provocative fingers of tangled clay erupting from dark orifices. Friend and fellow artist Edward Ruscha once described them as "psycho-erotic." The stylistic break with Voulkos was complete. The beautifully crafted and brightly painted work was as effortless and triumphant as the playful surfing poster implied.
A: Earth's seasons are due to its 23.5 degree axis tilt.
Sajid recently handed out campaign brochures after a popular weekly prayer service at the mosque. The pamphlets were slathered in colorful drawings of U.S. flags and the bullet points of his conservative political platform: support existing businesses, no local property tax, protect property rights by repealing an ordinance that threatens a $1,000 fine for leaving snow on private property sidewalks. He has sent more than 900 brochures through the mail and hopes to follow up with calls during his lunch breaks.
The fire led to a bill pending in the legislature requiring smoke and carbon monoxide detectors to be installed in most residences. Stamford officials have pressed state lawmakers to pass the bill.
It was an abrupt and stunning turnabout for a proud franchise that had made the playoffs the past three seasons. It was a high-priced and experienced roster, and entering the season, the intrigue wasn't whether the team could reach the playoffs, it was whether the team could advance to the second round, or beyond. But even when the team raced to a 7-2 start, and found itself perched atop the Western Conference, all while garnering praise from Charles Barkley as one of the best teams in the West, McMillan never believed it.
Assemblywoman Caroline Casagrande (R-Monmouth) said the bill is "clearly written by adults making adult choices."

The weekend is here, as is PIFF, but so is the worst day of the year. Well, the Worst Day of the Year Ride, anyway. And Valentine's Day is getting close, so you may choose to celebrate that this weekend, unless you consider Feb. 14 the worst day of the year. Days are always what you make of them, I guess. Without further ado, here are some ideas for what to make of your weekend, in the form of a lovingly curated list of Portland events.

The system is terrible, economically and socially. Price controls limit supply and favor those who got there first. In 2011, someone moving into an unregulated Manhattan apartment paid an average $3,309, because of tight supply; the vacancy rate was less than 1%.

(On if the West Coast offense looks he wants it to and where he would want it to go)- "There's room for improvement. I think part of that had to do with the offseason not being able to use it. I think some of the things we do are okay. Are we all a little frustrated by our offense right now? Yeah, I think so, but am I surprised? No, it did take some time to really time this thing out. As I mentioned earlier, because we're young I suspect as the season goes along and every time they get one more game under their belt, one more game under their belt, listen to this, practice this, same plays and all that, that you should see a little bit more of an offense with a little more timing, a little more fluidness to it. You've seen this system work before and it works. It just takes some time to get on the same page. I think we were hurt just a little bit by what happened in the offseason, like a lot of teams. You can see it every once in a while out there."
Critics immediately said McCoy was a warm-weather player who couldn't function on the shore of Lake Erie late in the season. But Brian Sipe was from San Diego. Tom Brady is from near San Francisco. Drew Brees is from Texas. Favre, from Mississippi, coped with some of the league's worst weather at Lambeau Field.
Palo Alto was the most surprisingly sexed-up burb in the whole mix. It turns out that 1 in 5,000 in Palo Alto are seeking anal. compared to San Francisco, where 1 in 4,000 are looking for backdoor action, Palo Alto may seem paltry for the anal enthusiast and lube salesman alike (in both cases, 27 percent are M4M). But considering that in most Bay Area cities in my survey only 1 in 10,000 are seeking anal, Palo Alto is actually seeking twice as much anal action as the rest of the Bay Area.
"I'm hoping (No. 100) comes at Loudon (next week)," Busch said.
He's also put together a wine list that aims to please. For demanding wine drinkers, there are obscure bottles — a Barboursville, Va., moscato blend and a vouvray from the respected French estate Domaine Huet. But there are brands such as Urban and Geyser Peak that will be more familiar to regular diners. It also has a nice variety of New World and Old World wines. There are lots of American brands, including many from Maryland and Virginia.

The Predators don't have the same depth on defense, where the Wings' third pairing figures to be Quincey and Ian White. Jonathan Ericsson has shown himself a good partner for Nicklas Lidstrom, providing a 6-foot-4 presence who gives Lidstrom some room. Kronwall and Brad Stuart would be many a team's top pairing, giving Detroit a top-four who'll share minutes equally, whereas Nashville leans heavily on Suter and Weber. For Detroit's checking forwards, it's imperative to treat those two like they're wearing bull's-eyes.

While we know that Stern is "Sirius," we hope he wasn't "serious" with his negative comments about St. Louis. And we suggest another nickname for him if he was: schlock jock.
In addition to inadvertently suggesting that Meyer watched "Meet the Fockers" one too many times, the Sporting News story portrays him as a coach who pays lip service to professed high standards of "discipline" and "accountability."
How do I know? In part because the class is taught by Emma Parker, a dancer and choreographer with Cleveland's Dancing Wheels. If anybody locally knows how dancers warm up and cool down, and how to transpose those processes onto regular people, it's her.

For Romney, a Michigan defeat would be disastrous. Romney was born in Detroit and raised in Bloomfield Hills, an upscale suburb. In 2008, he won the Michigan primary by a comfortable nine-point margin over McCain. Losing the state where his father was a popular governor and where the Romney name is fondly remembered by older voters would cast a dark shadow over his presidential prospects and shatter the notion that he's still the front-runner.

Major defensive adjustment to start game was center Shaquille O'Neal guarding Kevin Garnett. The idea is O'Neal's size will limit Garnett's ability to get position and score from the post. Boston shrugged and starting running plays for Garnett on the perimeter as he made three jumpers over O'Neal and then set up a pick-and-roll that took advantage of him for another basket. It helped the Celtics start the game 7-of-11 from the floor to establish a lead.

The LaPlants, of Farmington, were the winning bidders on two of Clara Schmitt Rothmeier's prized baseball quilts at an auction Saturday in Union. Rothmeier, formerly of Gerald, died last year at age 78.
The House GOP response Tuesday morning was to break off talks and pass its version of the tax bill on a near-party-line vote. That kind of dealing won't get a stadium built, or keep the Vikings in Minnesota.
"The bill that emerged from the General Assembly retained the bull's-eye core of everything that I was aiming at," he said Friday. "So I was delighted that the heart of the legislation was retained."
The death of the 80-year-old Steinbrenner, who had been in poor health for years, highlights a quirky tax situation that has drawn much scrutiny among the moneyed but little on Main Street. Only those with estates valued at more than $3.5 million had to pay under the old law.

If he is, than that has to be the world's highest radar level. Right now, if you're underestimating Edwin's scoring ability than you either don't care or aren't paying attention. Saturday afternoon, Edwin tallied a career-high 24 points in the win over Providence. Tuesday night, he had 24 points — in the first half. By the end of the night, he had set a new career-high with 28 points and has firmly established himself as a bona fide scorer. The Paterson Catholic product has always been thought of as a slasher, but now he's become a true scoring threat. In the last two games, he is 9-of-13 from 3-point range and is an absolute nightmare on the fast-break. He was really locked down in the second half by DePaul — something which we expect he'll see more of — but to be honest, Edwin's probably eclipsed Herb Pope as the second scoring option for this year. For now, at least.
Here are some other points from their session:
The money-losing nursing home was transferred to the SCIA from the county in August 2008. At the time, the home was running annual deficits well over $1 million and was a continued drain on the county budget as it had been for years.

Our debate about whether to get another slice was cut short by the arrival of warm, doughy bread and small salads, which came with the dinner pastas we ordered.

City Councilman Mike Polensek said in an interview this week that the city should be more concerned about offering recreational opportunities to children than to golfers. But he doubts that a private company would tolerate restrictions on how much to charge.
That is the vision now, from the top of the organization on down. Kalil is expected to be the Vikings' starting left tackle into the 2020s. And Ponder, it's hoped, will be the lone quarterback behind him, jelling into a true NFL standout in part because of the peace of mind he's getting from his protection.
But spend a couple hours downtown or visit one of the smaller wineries on Diamond Mountain and see their extraordinary vistas, and you'll conclude that the extra few miles up the highway have kept Calistoga just a little bit apart from the rest of Napa. The town retains that feel of pre-wonderland Napa. Its residents prefer it that way. If you're willing to go the extra few miles north, you'll find that, too.

On the campaign trail, all the 13 candidates have had to face public exposure, often more focused on the personal than on their economic or social programs. That could be a sign of how their programs had few clear differences on tackling Egypt's myriad of woes — but also a reflection of the new fixation of finding out as much as possible about the new leader.

Blazers center Marcus Camby: "Tonight he just solidified that he is the best power forward in the game."
Tressel wasnt surviving this. There was no way. He blatantly lied to his superiors and NCAA investigators, breaching explicit terms of his contract. But Tressel became leverage for the university with the NCAA. His bosses defiantly stood by him. Forcing out a coach they so staunchly supported just weeks earlier  and who was so successful against the Buckeyes arch enemy  sends another signal to the NCAA that Ohio State is sternly policing itself, purging the program of the root of the compliance problems.
Similar to the German model, Oregon is close to launching a feed-in tariff, which would require utility companies to buy electricity from owners of solar systems. It guarantees a set price over a length of time, eventually covering the cost of the system, encouraging consumers to buy solar panels.

Season recap: The versatile Todd set a state record in the triple jump at 41 feet, 5 inches at the Chandler Rotary Invitational. She then ran 11.73 seconds to win the 100 meters at the meet, but crossed the finish line hobbling with a slight hamstring pull. She shut it down for a while, but came on strong at season's end, despite not being 100 percent recovered. She won the long jump, triple jump and anchored Chandler's winning 4x100 relay at the Division I championships at Mesa Community College. She topped her 19-6� long jump at state the following week with a leap of 19-8� at the Meet of Champions.

Terry Gilbert, an attorney for D'Ambrosio, said his client could not speak with a reporter, citing pending lawsuits. He sued the state in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court for wrongful imprisonment earlier this year; he also sued prosecutors and other county officials in U.S. District Court last year, claiming his civil rights were violated. Each case is pending.
Attorneys in Cuyahoga County are not assigned as counsel until after indictment and county arraignment. Now that may be quite convenient for the attorney (especially those who benefit at taxpayers' expense from an assignment system to a tune reaching six figures annually), but it's hell on the client sitting in the county jail. And it often means indictments issued that were entirely avoidable.

Sightlines in the stadium and proximity to the field will be a priority. One of the Metrodome's endearing qualities is the noise level that the fans generate, ear-splitting volume that gives the Vikings one of the better home-field advantages in the league. The Wilfs want to recreate that atmosphere as much as possible.
So, I ask: Do we want our state government -- and thus, by extension, all of us -- to be in the business of taking lives in what amounts to a death lottery? I can't imagine that's something about which most of us feel comfortable. And, thus, I believe the time has come to abolish the death penalty in Ohio.

The loss, which could go higher, is a rare blow to the reputation of Dimon, 56, a native New Yorker known for his hands-on management style and a confident swagger. After successfully steering his bank through the market turmoil of 2008 and the recession, he is perhaps the most influential bank executive in the country -- and a vocal critic of the efforts to write rules under the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul.

Yet these laws do little to help poor workers. In January, economists at Charles River Associates prepared a report for the mayor on a similar bill. They found that some low-paid workers would get raises — but others would become unemployed. And the pain would be worst in The Bronx and Staten Island, because those boroughs have more low-wage workers.

Adam: This contest is a legitimate dream match for me as a wrestling fan. I've long been a fan of both men, so the prospect of seeing them face off on the grandest stage of all is an amazing feel. I, too, expect this match to be the best of the night from an in-ring standpoint and just hope it will be alloted enough time to truly become something special, a WrestleMania classic for the ages. While I still don't feel the addition of Punk's family crises was necessary, it helps add to this feud, which I believe is only getting started. Punk and Jericho are too good a pairing to only have one match, and ultimately, I believe Jericho will sneak out with the win and the WWE title. Jericho will be able to gloat and carry the mantle of "best in the world" right into a series of rematches.

This is just the tip of a metaphorical iceberg. I've left out many jobs, but I hope in highlighting a few you get a sense of the diversity of ocean-related professions. As you can see, while many marine scientists dive for work, most don't and still have interesting, fun and important jobs.
Any of these improvements would be a major achievement for what has become a broken and costly public obligation.

As the goalkeepers wandered out for warm-ups, the crowd erupted and I witnessed the phenomenon that is Hope Solo. She’s an extremely talented goalkeeper and athlete, and her smile was contagious as she high fived some waiting fans as she ran out to complete pre-game drills. The crowd yelled messages of encouragement. Ok, they yelled a lot, and the screams varied from actual words to just extremely high pitched wails. Solo did her best to keep on task, waiving to the crowd at points while going through her pre-match drills. The noise got more deafening as the full teams moved out for pre-match drills. I heard plenty of yells of “We love you” with the player’s name at the end to just about everyone, while the signs of support were now scattered throughout the park. As the crowd started to fill in, the noise became more apparent but instead of the usual crescendo of chants for the Timbers, the atmosphere felt more appropriate for a popular band.
He takes us downstairs, where workers are finishing construction on Ginny's Supper Club (the room has just opened for business). The sleekly designed space will host different kinds of music - jazz and Latin, for example. Only this one, Samuelsson notes, "will have really good food."

NJTV took control of the former New Jersey Network on July 1, after Christie officials signed a five-year deal with Public Media/NJ, a subsidiary of Channel 13/WNET.

In some of the country's most ambitious dog houses, meat has strayed to the unusual — rabbit and duck and heritage pig, topped variously with chutneys and aiolis and other exotica. Jason Fernandez, owner of the 6-month-old Hot Willy's Sausage and Italian Beef Superstore in Ybor City, has kept his vision more on terra firma. That didn't stop the Wall Street Journal from including the newcomer recently in a best-hot dog roundup. Opened at the beginning of the year, the casual stand has a number of things going for it.

For his off-Broadway debut, he’s upped all the antes. Over the course of nearly three hours, “Burning” and its cast of 13 leap back and forth between New York and Berlin, the early 1980s and the present.

The track's dwindling purses have made it difficult just to break even during its summer racing season, even with a winning horse.

"Our approach against Moyer was just to try to see something over the plate and be aggressive, but not so aggressive on stuff that's falling off the edge of the plate," Dodgers right fielder Andre Ethier said. "There's a lot of movement on some of the pitches he's throwing, so you're going to swing and miss sometimes. But you've got to keep taking your hacks and not be discouraged if you're swinging through some of those pitches or even strike out."

“We knew that we were going to staff this one,” said Sorge after the contest. “Sometimes when you get backed up with some rainouts you hate to have, particularly, your better guys sit and wait. We’ll just keep them on a rotation and get their work in. We’ve got conference games on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, so today, instead of them ‘penning’ (‘bull-penning’) them, (we put them) on some inning counts. They just went out there (pointing to the pitcher’s mound) to do some work instead of doing it over there (motioning to the bullpen). I think we could have thrown in the bullpen, but you get a little bit different juice flowing through your veins when you’re out there in a game. So that’s obviously a little bit more productive.”

Although the 11th-hour drama centered on the House and the Senate, Mr. O'Malley is ultimately the one in charge, and the debacle reflects badly on him. He had some harsh words after the fact — in a 1 a.m. news conference, he decried those who let "egos and pet projects" get in the way of the "common good," and this morning, he referred to the previous night's events as a "damn shame" that set the state back. Where was he a week ago when it was clear that the two chambers were on a collision course? He needed to be publicly and aggressively involved in pushing the debate from the start, but instead, he took a laissez-faire attitude toward the legislature's handling of the budget. Tweeting "Hopeful that the GA will pass a compromise that protects priorities like education while creating jobs & expanding opportunity" two hours and 13 minutes before the legislature is set to adjourn doesn't cut it.

Oh man, Merle Dixon (portrayed by Michael Rooker) is so cool. He's like Daryl Dixon except without all the namby pambiness and pussyfooting. Yeah he's racist, sexist, boorish and homophobic, but he comes up with lots of good cutdowns and the camera loves him!

(On if he feels he has to draft all offensive players with the first three picks)- "In a perfect world, you'd like to take the best player at a need position, but we are not living in a perfect world. To say we are taking three offensive guys with our first three picks, I would not say that. Like I said, in a perfect world yes, but we are not going to do it just to go it. We can't. There are guys that we hope are there, but if they are not, you just can't say let's just go to the next offensive guy and skip over these five really good defensive players. That makes no sense to me."

A newer entry into the rental market is homes being rented by owners who haven't been able to sell. With information on local rental prices widely available online, these first-time landlords will likely be asking for market prices, says Jed Smith, managing director for quantitative research at the National Association of Realtors. Since their ultimate goal is to sell the property, these landlords may be more serious about maintenance of the property than a landlord who owns multiple properties, he says. So make sure a lease specifies who is responsible for taking care of—and paying for—what.

The two left El Salvador — which was probably for the best — and landed in Nicaragua. "The two countries were nothing alike," she writes. "El Salvador was your basic mail-order military dictatorship: terror and torture, stuttering civilians. Nicaragua was more like a cheerful Communist kazoo concert." With supplies for the Sandinista regime coming from the Soviet Union, left-leaning foreigners — Internacionalistas, they were called — flocked to the country, some lending real support, some holding inappropriately festive rallies.

If there's anything coaches like less than a cheat, it is a hypocrite. Should Harbaugh's Ravens bend the rules so much as a centimeter going forward, they can expect payback to be prompt and derision to be deafening.

Browns daughters  Susie, Katie and Fiona, 6, 4 and 2 years old at the time  arrived in time to start school in January. Brown recalled that first school day: There was an ice storm, and his wife and the girls were walking up and down the street in the freezing weather, looking for the school bus. A neighbor came out, he said, and mercifully told them they could wait inside, where it was warm. The bus would come, right to their house.

Because of that, there are clusters of furniture and breakout rooms throughout the building, outdoors and in the cafeteria.
Decades later these two men, who had never met, became, respectively, a doctor and a nutrition researcher.

They've all been around the blockbuster block, individually or in smaller combinations.

Nearly 70 percent of Mesa voters who are likely to participate in November's election would support a bond issue to fund school improvements, according to a consultant.
Even if the reform law falls, the exchanges are still worth having. Although the provision of the federal law that critics object to most strongly — the mandate requiring everyone to buy health insurance or pay a penalty — would play a central role in achieving lower insurance costs, the state health exchanges themselves are a separate issue that don't depend on whether the mandate is constitutional. The exchanges can't force anyone to buy coverage, nor will they have the authority to directly set insurance rates. Their purpose is to set minimum benefit packages for insurance plans offered in the state and select the best values for consumers at a variety of coverage levels.

Newark spokeswoman Esmeralda Diaz Cameron said the city is not at fault. "The city can not tell an employee what to file," she said. "In addition, the city has over 4,000 employees making it difficult to track one person’s W-4. The city would never knowingly fail to comply with an IRS directive."

The expansive beauty, serenity and relative safety of these two parks offered ideal spaces to train. For me, running through the streets was not an option for many reasons, including exhaust fumes and road-ragers. And, if I had been relegated to logging anywhere from two to 18 miles on an oval track at the local high school, I would have certainly been driven to the brink of insanity.
Robin Jones, a Newark resident and grandparent, said her grandchild attends Camden Elementary, one of the schools slated for consolidation. She said the plan would jeopardize their prospects for success.
But scandal will come again if the university does not come up with answers to the questions I asked Geiger six years ago. Somehow, the university has to find a way to police player misconduct.

The restaurant's vegetable "coins" ($13) are reminiscent of Indian kofta - they're fried patties of broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and celery. But here they're served in Manchurian sauce, a puree of broccoli with soy sauce, onion and ginger. The result is a comforting dish, if a little greasy, though it's good for absorbing spiciness.

The recruiting process for kickers is far different from that of the other position players. Colleges concentrate on filling needs at the other positions and then the coaches decide whether kicker is a position at which they can offer a scholarship.

Oregon's production at the plate has been the story thus far this season. The Ducks are batting .285 with 77 runs scored. If they can maintain that level of production against top-tier teams over one weekend, it could be time to wonder just how far this UO team could go this season.

While every city worldwide claims to have the "best" pizza, Napoli truly can boast this -- pizza margherita with mozzarella cheese and tomatoes, on a thin, nearly burned crust. It's simple but delicious. In March 2006, my mother traveled from the States to Italy to visit us and our 51/2-year-old son, Joshua. My mother, Joshua and I enjoyed a wonderful day trip from the Navy base in Gricignano to the island of Procida, just off the famous Amalfi Coast. The culmination of our trip? Dinner at a family-run pizzeria, where all the participants were fortunate to be able to make their own pizza from scratch, observe it baking in the famous brick pizza oven and then ultimately indulge in devouring their pizza. This is among my favorite memories of Italy. -- Elizabeth Krempasky, Strongsville

6. Alan Rickman/Severus Snape: If ever a villain in an action movie deserved an Oscar nod, it was Rickman for his classic turn as Hans Gruber in the original "Die Hard." But he also has shown a great range with stand-out turns in both "Galaxy Quest," "Robin Hood," "Michael Collins," "Sense and Sensibility" and "Love Actually."

Last month, the university canceled raises and froze the salaries of all 13,000 employees on its New Brunswick, Newark and Camden campuses. Rutgers’ unions, including the union representing professors, are mounting a legal challenge to lift the salary freeze.
"We moved up one, but I think potentially we'll move up even higher. Because of the timing of the law and when it passed, we're in the very early stages of finding out about companies staying and expanding, and companies we might not have had a shot at before giving us a second look," he said.

Subalpine forests and tundra are expected to decline as temperatures rise, while forests are expected to replace some grassland and shrubland in eastern Oregon. Increases in ocean temperatures could lead to more "dead zones" in productive nearshore waters.
Why it's hot: The weekly "Pulp the Party" helped spark a renaissance for subculture dance nights in Ybor City and beyond. No need to peacock here, folks; just let your freak flag fly. "It's about blowing off steam and not having to pop your collars or putting on a jacket," said mastermind Paul Geller, a.k.a. DJ Pauly Crush, of Orlando. "We take pride in delivering music that isn't being played at other clubs yet, or maybe ever will — certainly not on the radio." That means maintaining a core group of like-minded DJs with similar musical tastes; Geller even grooms new up-and-coming DJs to fill in. Pulp also brings quality drink specials, like a free keg of Stella Artois, $1 and $2 vodka drinks and free vodka shots when a snow machine goes off twice an hour. For Pulp's third anniversary party in July, they offered free drinks from 9 p.m. to midnight, and there was a line around the block to get in.
In Part Two, we examined California's prison system. Although it is the most expensive in the nation, it is plagued by outdated policies, severe overcrowding and a high recidivism rate. Efforts to reform the system are attacked as "soft on crime."

Close family friend Aretha Franklin, whom Houston lovingly called "Aunt Ree," had been expected to sing at the service, but said early Saturday she was too ill to attend. Franklin said in an email to The Associated Press that she had been up most of the night with leg spasms and sent best wishes to the family.
I've been testing the Dell XPS 13, and there is a lot to like about it, even beyond its compact dimensions. I found it to be solid and well built, speedy and with a good, backlit keyboard, a bright screen, and good looks. It emerged from standby mode quickly and reliably. But this machine has a major downside: subpar battery life. In my standard test, it fell about an hour short of the longest-lived competing ultrabook I've tested and two hours short of the 13-inch MacBook Air.
* Here's what I'm hoping to see from Adam Wainwright this evening at Wrigley Field: improved command. He's thrown his fastball 50 percent of the time, and it's been hittable, as we know. Opponents are batting .333 against the fastball, with a .704 slugging percentage. But the problem is more location than velocity. Wainwright has left too many fastballs over the belly of the plate; 60 percent have been in the strike zone, and he isn't getting it past many hitters who seem to be looking for it. But it's more than just the fastball; if Wainwright can have sharper command of his secondary pitches, it would make his fastball more effective. The famous Wainwright curve has been all over the place; he's thrown it in the zone only 30 percent of the time. (But on a positive note, he is getting hitters to chase it.) I've said it before, but this is a process for Wainwright. Be patient.

KG: I was feeling like, this is happening, I'm still in contention. In practice when I go for my last really hard sprint, my last repeat, I always take my gloves off. I don't know why, it just makes me feel free, like there's nothing holding me back any more. So I was just, like, the gloves have got to go. I need every little ounce to muster up this kick.
In the plan, four years in the making, Adams envisioned 700 miles of new lanes, trails and boulevards to entice Portlanders to make one-quarter of all their trips by bike.

When Obama does cover those fine arms, the past 100 days have been a veritable ode to the cardigan. She gravitates to sheath dresses, pearls, the occasional A-line skirt, and is likely to avoid trousers for anything but the most informal of settings. She doesn't shy away from print or patterns. With her impressive height, she can wear them easily.

"Playboy, moi?" Sachs once asked a reporter, giving collective voice to many of his peers. "I would rather call myself a gentleman." Famous for wooing French bombshell Brigitte Bardot by dropping hundreds of roses onto the grounds of her house from a helicopter (it worked, she married him) and the mock boast that he never worked a day in his life, Sachs left behind a bankroll estimated to be as much as $455 million, a modest sum compared to the billions being made by today's mega-yacht crowd.
For a city accustomed to blazing trails and winning rave reviews, it's hard to hear that we're falling so woefully short. In fact, many Portlanders no doubt have mixed feelings about Jackson, or any other outsider, dropping by and daring to tell us what we're doing wrong.
"There is no one, single answer when someone says: ‘What is the right carseat for me?'" McHale said. Store associates can help people figure out what they need.

She’s after that kind of intimacy because she always has been an artist with a message to deliver. Sometimes it’s been an autobiographical one — about her life, her desires, her fantasies.

It is the position that he spent the most time at in the minors, and there was a time when scouts would say it's his "natural" position. The position isn't the question. It's how would Descalso fare as an everyday starter at any position? The Cardinals don't have to answer that question now. As the roster sits right now, the Cardinals can hold s competition for playing time at second, pitting Descalso against incumbent Skip Schumaker and newly cast utility infielder Tyler Greene. Don't be surprised if the Cardinals elect to go with a committee at second base. It's worked out before. See: 2011.
Making every effort to secure an interview with Orton after she appeared at SXSW in Austin, Texas, and was touring her way toward California, I managed to make only momentary telephone contact during her stopover in Salt Lake City. Before she begged off for tea and breakfast, Orton did acknowledge that she'd grown weary of the compulsive perfectionism engendered by studio-centric recording. (Attempts to follow up were thwarted first by the demands of sound check and then by noise outside and inside the Mexican restaurant Orton was ducking into for a bite before the gig.)
Malkin suggested that random record checks would suffice. But Cagen disagreed, particularly for pre-1970 pipelines that were built with welds with a history of failure. Unlike newer lines, those pipes were not required to be tested with high-pressure water before being installed.

Now, however, with Clinton scheduled to begin high-level talks with senior officials in Beijing on Thursday, the dash to the capital city by self-taught lawyer Chen Guangcheng has pushed the issue to the fore. Unless the situation is resolved quickly, it's likely to become a serious irritant in the United States' relationship with China, the second-largest economy in the world and a crucial stakeholder in matters that range from North Korea's nuclear weapons-development program to sanctions on Iran.

Cake, Kahlua, cream) also shows the versatility of cake vodka. It tasted less like coffee than I'd hoped, but it was quite good.
In the first two games of 2012 he accumulated 16 points, a pace that would have shattered NCAA records. But Pannell suffered a broken foot against Army in the second game. The normal recovery time, just to walk, is eight weeks. This injury impacts his dodges and cuts — a player puts four to five times his body weight on the plant foot. It'll be eight weeks since the injury Saturday night when Cornell visits Ivy league rival Princeton. And when Pannell will return to the field is a mystery.
His Bacon and Beer Festival certainly succeeded, first in the realm of social media, which put the event on the map, and now as part of wider Hub food culture.

For this recipe, which can be assembled completely ahead of time, I parboil the lobsters very briefly and then cut them up. I allow one 1 1/2-pound lobster per person.

Should be like 10-14 points, right? Well, it is a dogfight; Why? Because the Rockets have hit five 3-pointers and the Cavs have hit one and it came in the last second of the half. Also, Houston had 15 made free throws and the Cavs have just six. The fouls are even. What you have here is why the Rockets are so scrappy. They find ways to win.

Hanging in the balance is the state’s commercial mollusk industry — a $790 million annual fishing business that pulls clams, oysters and mussels from coastal waters deemed clean by the DEP. The FDA said it may have to close the industry if the DEP fails to improve its patrols this summer and if the state Department of Health and Senior Services fails to improve inspections it is required to conduct at shellfish processing plants.

The Church at Pierce Creek case is not even analogous to the Pulpit Initiative. The Pulpit Initiative is not about churches running full-page political ads in newspapers. Indeed, in that case, the church never asserted that placing the ad was part of its free exercise of religion. In contrast, a pastor speaking from the pulpit to his congregation is the "core" of the free exercise of religion. As you must know, no federal court has ever been confronted with a constitutional challenge to the government's restriction on what a pastor says from the pulpit. The point of the Pulpit Initiative is to create a legal precedent that restores the right of pastors to speak freely from the pulpit without government censorship or control.

In the 1980s, while non-Angelenos may have assumed that Milliken and Feniger were impressing customers with their exoticisms, the truth was that the chefs assumed most of the people in the dining room had tasted these things in their original form. Not all of their customers had been to Thailand, Lisbon or India, but a lot of them had; if not, Thai Town, Little Tokyo and Little India were not far away. (As Jonathan Roberts' review in the old California magazine read, if you weren't sure what chrysanthemum leaves were supposed to taste like in a salad, you were supposed to pretend that you did.)

Mr. Boehner has resisted crafting a plan that will attract any of them out of the realization that it would irreparably fracture his caucus and threaten his leadership. But after his initial failure to round up the 217 Republican votes needed to pass his plan, the speaker surely must realize that it's already too late to avoid that. President Obama, speaking at the White House yesterday morning, pointed out the obvious lesson that Mr. Boehner should have taken away from Thursday's events: "Any solution to avoid default must be bipartisan."

A: It has always been a goal of mine to be a head coach and have an opportunity to develop a team and we're there now. We're developing this team.

Mike Brown came in and Danny Ferry made the right moves, and LeBron and his guys fell right into it. Those are the types of things we have to do with this team. I just want to be a part of that building and development process and see it come to fruition in the end.
Still the most important single performance for the Mets Sunday had to be Santana's.

Darlington is a fine reporter and writer whose earlier books have covered subjects as varied as the Mojave Desert and Area 51. He previously assayed the wine world in "Angels' Visits," which pondered the mysteries of Zinfandel. In this book, he approached wine more from the point of view of a besotted admirer. Now, 20 years later, his gaze is a little more distanced and his appreciation a lot more nuanced.

The story of immigrants arriving from overseas or relocating from the Southern states is peppered with interesting tidbits (like the $30,000 price tag for Diego Rivera's epic murals at the Detroit Institute of Arts) and stark realities, like the government-sanctioned segregation that fostered the city-suburban split.

Suited up in a tux, he moved lightly from table to table, and motioned with long, tapered fingers.

This mandate represents one of the largest intrusions on individual and religious freedom in American history, and it sets a dangerous precedent. Never before has the federal government attempted to force the American people to buy products that blatantly violate their own personal beliefs or religious views. It is completely unconstitutional and needs to be stopped.
But labor productivity is only one of many costs that go into operating an assembly plant. The St. Paul plant is inefficiently designed and underutilized. It makes one model, the Ranger, that appeals to a shrinking number of consumers.

The reports offered a mixed picture for the economy one day before the government reports on job growth in November. Economists project that employers added a net 125,000 jobs. That's not enough to lower the unemployment rate, which is projected to stay at 9 percent for the second straight month.

The crony capitalist deals with the Solyndras of the world are at an end. The massive health care bills that nobody can now figure out how to pay for are yesterday. The president can't keep fighting with this all or nothing attitude. It makes him look like Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard, an aging starlet who still thinks she commands the crowds she once did.
This dazzling adaptation of Philip Pullman's fantasy novel proves that Oscar-winning visual effects aren't enough. By playing it safe and cutting the controversial anti-Christian elements, the producers disappointed the novel's fans. The sanitized story about a girl facing grown-up problems in a parallel world with talking animals might have scored with younger audiences, if not for the PG-13 rating. Will young Lyra Belacqua return in the planned sequel, "The Subtle Knife"? "Compass" cost $180 million and made $70 million. Do the math. 113 minutes. A two-disc version has tons of extras.
Falling house prices can slow numerous sectors of the economy. They demoralize consumers by eroding their chief source of wealth. A 30 percent drop in housing prices has vaporized $7 trillion in home equity since 2006.

"This league has a habit, and I am just going to say habit, of producing some pretty incredible story lines," Kahn said.

I told Kevin: ‘We’re toast.’ This is not happening for us and I was right.."

I like where NetZero is going with this idea. High-speed USB sticks and portable hot spots have been around for years, eliminating the need to hunt for good Wi-Fi or to stay in one place with a fast connection. But their monthly fees—on top of monthly phone bills and home Internet bills—made them a luxury item.
That could be why she wasn’t surprised when her son had to check his ego everywhere else, too, and didn’t mind. He had the kind of talent that wouldn’t force him to. Before he went to St. Patrick, he was one of the most sought-after grade school players on the East Coast.
Hansen will be away for 2 1/2 weeks in early October, the first of three trips to take place in the next year and a half to two years.

One more trend: The app economy, which did not exist four years ago, is now estimated to be a $20 billion industry in the United States that employs 466,000 people.

"I wish we could put the first three quarters together like we did the fourth," coach Byron Scott said. "We couldn't throw the ball in the ocean for the first three quarters. It was tough.

Late Friday, the Treasury Department announced it was resorting to the final steps in an unusual series designed to avoid exceeding the current $14.3 trillion debt limit.

"It doesn't matter," she says. "I don't think they have any advantage." The only concession to their blindness is that all matches start with competitors holding opponents' lapels. By remaining in contact, the blind fighter can erase any sight advantage. "I can actually feel what you are about to do, so you try to do something, I can reverse it," Danyelle explains.

Adds Copeland, "They don't know until they've seen these young girls' faces, girls who have been told they will never be accepted into this world because of the color of their skin. This is today — I speak to 7-year-olds who have been told this. If I had been told this, I wouldn't be where I am."
President Obama attempted to dull the pain young Americans are feeling when he recently told a group of college students in Florida he "wasn't born with a silver spoon in his mouth" then went on to blame the mess we're in on capitalism. He described capitalism as a "broken down theory."

"On Sunday, Sept. 11, I went downtown to the Cleveland Pops concert. A policeman was sitting in his car, and I asked him if the concert was going to go on because it was raining. He said he had just gotten word to open up a street because the concert was canceled. Another SUV drove up and asked the same question and was turned away. On the 11 p.m. news I saw that the concert did go on. I was very upset and really wanted to go to it. Also I would like to moan about all the parking meters with orange covers on them saying 'no parking.' Why do they do that? I think it is bad public relations for the city when so many people can park on the street and it doesn't interfere with the flow of traffic."
This newly published article details one of two clinical trials that were evaluated by the FDA before the agency decided to deny approval for Qnexa in October 2010.

Curse words and all.
Sarkozy also pushed for a new era of industrial relations when he came to power in 2007. But unions still hold enormous sway in France. When he faced down transit unions just months after his election over the scrapping of an early retirement age, it seemed a seminal moment for a country long hemmed in by organized labor. However, by 2010, strikes again paralyzed France as he fought to raise the retirement age to 62.

Getting on one's Lycra and wearing it out in public is becoming a holiday tradition for some, however, as the Santa Speedo Run in Portland just celebrated its third year. I was a witness. There were plenty of Santa hats, suspenders and spandex skivvies to gawk at. Fundraising for the Ethiopia Project, the Santa Speedo 5K down Northwest 23rd Avenue, raised about $1,600 for the Portland nonprofit this month. With just 50 or so runners, that amount would not have been possible without a slew of unpaid volunteers and a large donation of beer from Deschutes Brewery. The Ethiopia Project gathers shoes to create recreational opportunities in Ethiopia. It also is working to help villages get clean water and build new schools. (Learn more about the Ethiopia Project online at Ethiopiaproject.com. The group needs money and volunteers -- and shoes.)
The ailing Nickeas, who has regressed since first becoming ill with flulike symptoms on Sunday in Colorado, was sent back to the team hotel before the Mets’ 6-3 loss to the Astros Tuesday night.

The idea is among those under consideration by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.
Love: In the meantime, "Good Vibrations" was our answer to that psychedelic era, to what was going on at the time. It's our most successful, unique song that we've ever done. Brian did an amazing job on it with the structure of the track, with the harmonies. I collaborated by writing the lyrics, "I'm picking up good vibrations." It was so unique in its use of the theremin. In fact, Rolling Stone said it was the single of the century.
He told them that he had prayed for guidance and read Scripture about facing adversity and coming out on top. And he assured the faithful that as they go back to where they started, in a high school auditorium, the trials that have crippled them for so long will soon be over.

More than 20 million Americans are living with diabetes, and another 40 million are in the early stages of the disease. Managing diabetes can be a challenge all year long, but the holidays can pose special problems. All those extra treats, meals and drinks can add up to extra pounds and higher glucose levels. But a little planning, and will power, can keep diabetes in check, according to Susan Steinweg, a registered nurse and a certified diabetes educator. She's also the coordinator of Carroll Hospital Center's Diabetes Center.
And it's not just commerce. Once our friends and family knew our phone number and called us on our home phones -- but people who were neither could look us up and do the same. Now we increasingly carry cellphones instead of using landlines, and we don't want our new numbers listed. We don't see the need, because even though we have phones all the time, we're also reachable via text messages and email and social-networking sites -- and in many situations we're coming to prefer those communications methods to the insistent, one-size-fits-some summons of a ringing phone. Sometimes we don't need to communicate directly at all -- we drop by our friends' Web pages, Facebook profiles or MySpace outposts to get the latest, and update ours so they can do the same.

Michael Silver, Yahoo! Sports: "As ferocious as he was on the field, he played with a childlike exuberance that carried over into the locker room and beyond. Listen to Seau's former teammates mourn his loss, and don't believe for a moment that anything they're saying is insincere or exaggerated for effect. They loved the guy, and there were a lot of people who felt that way."

Like the topsy-turvy, inverted-logic "wonderland" of Lewis Carroll's famous story, Mexico and California, where several female surrealists settled, seemed places where the normal art-world rules were made to be broken. They were free-form zones where female artists felt empowered to explore their own fantasies at a comfortable distance from the male art-critical establishment in New York and Europe.
Other incidents over the past 15 years haven't helped the Secret Service come off as welcoming to women. Emails filed as part of a race discrimination lawsuit show workers sharing racially and sexually inappropriate jokes. An alcohol-soaked bar brawl involving off-duty agents in 2002 involved allegations that an agent had bitten off part of a man's ear — though no charges were brought and a jury sided with the agent in a civil trial. A 2002 U.S. News & World Report contained allegations of heavy drinking, pornography viewing at work and security lapses.

Moser said that even as the Odones were accusing him of going too slow, he was hearing from medical colleagues outraged that the oil treatment was being oversold; some families spent fortunes getting their hands on it only to find it didn't help.

Located opposite government buildings and an easy stroll to restaurants, pubs, shopping, museums and a variety of sightseeing options, a stay at The Merrion is an opportunity to experience the best of Georgian Dublin.
It is also important that the incoming president not only appoint people of differing philosophies, but that he's also willing to listen to their viewpoints as the governing process goes forward. Paul O'Neill may or may not have been the best choice for Treasury secretary in the first term of the Bush administration, but it really didn't matter that much. His own account of his tenure indicates that his principal function was to serve as a potted plant -- hauled out for photo opportunities when the administration wanted to make it appear that he supported its policies despite the fact that he had little input in developing them.
This left Wilf furious because Childress did not consult with ownership before making his decision.

I learned that sometimes smaller jobs can be appreciated more than working on big building projects. Two years ago, a New Jersey Realtor referred a client to me to see if I could help them to update bathrooms in a house that they wanted to sell. I took it on without hesitation, sketched it out and wished them all the best. We gutted two bathrooms and put in new toilets, sinks, tile, sconces, fans, vanities and faucets. The changes helped them to sell their house.

In 2012, this is a system that works. The Giants won a Super Bowl despite having their secondary destroyed before the start of the season. As much as Smith wants a "dictating, dominating defense," the NFL blueprint for winning has changed.

Lest you assume all visually and acoustically isolating seating to be a product of the iPod age, behold the Canopy Chair. It's a reproduction of a "porter's chair," which hails from the 16th century. Back in the day, the hall porter would hunker down in one of these; the high seat back and sides protected him from front-door drafts, while the hooded headrest helped him stay attuned to distant sounds. Its signature headrest is just as practical today. The "hoodie" is kind of like holding your hands up to your ears: In noisy environments, it makes conversations more intelligible; in quieter places, chatting with someone feels more intimate. If the burlap and exposed brass nailheads of this reproduction aren't your style, there are other equivalents. Jaime Hayon's Showtime Poltrona for BD Barcelona is a sleeker, but no less spectacular version, and it comes in glossy indoor and matte outdoor versions. $1,895, jaysonhome.com

A detail. What does "Redemption" mean in the title? Who, or what, is redeemed, and how? If you kill lots of people and are still alive, have you been redeemed? If you and your brother don't kill each other after almost everyone else does, is that redemption? Or is "redemption" just one of those title words like "reloaded" or "destiny" to help people tell movies apart?

Flexible in the wrong ways, inflexible in the wrong ways, self-contradictory and at times simply muddled, it would have mandated that homework count for no more than 10% of a student's grade — meaning that it would make very little difference even if a student blew off half of it. At the same time, it failed to set appropriate amounts of homework based on students' ages and grade levels. It never differentiated between routine, daily homework and, say, final papers for a class, and assumed in alarming ways that disadvantaged and minority students were less capable of doing homework than others.
Interspersed throughout Korta's patter were glimpses of times when Krakow and Poland were run by someone other than Poles. Much of the story, however, is of geographical (not philosophical or psychological) subjugation.

Jennifer Aniston brings a needed liveliness to "Derailed," though not enough to go around. She's Lucinda Harris, a financial planner who embarks on an affair with Clive Owen's Charles Schine, a TV commercial executive with sufficient stress in his home life to explain why he responds to Lucinda's wry ministrations. In this violent, yet often pedestrian thriller directed by Mikael Hfström, the couple pays dearly for their transgressions. First they're terrorized by a thug, Phillippe Laroche, played to the psychotic hilt by Vincent Cassel. Then Charles, who is both a hunk and something of a wimp, struggles to act like a man when Laroche turns high-stakes blackmailer.

Many vegan dishes, however, are already beloved; we eat fruit salad, peanut butter and jelly, beans and rice, eggplant in marinara sauce. The problem faced by many of us - brought up as we were with plates whose center was filled with a piece of an animal - is in imagining less-traditional vegan dishes that are creative, filling, interesting and not especially challenging to either put together or enjoy.

Palin, a Fox News contributor and onetime local sportscaster, spent the 8 a.m. hour loosely participating in a variety of segments alongside "Today" host Ann Curry and company.

Here's a sampling of other Bora-Bora hotels, ranging from high-end to low-end. Most have beautiful views and over-water bungalows; all are well-maintained. Travelers to French Polynesia usually can save money by buying resort-and-airfare packages.
The idea comes from a report by the Annie E. Casey Foundation that found that students who cannot read at their grade level by the end of third grade are four times more likely to drop out of school later.

"I think a lot of the furniture is interesting. It's material with age that you would not be able to purchase even in Thailand. A lot of it is quite rare," Tingley said.
Calgary would be interested in Andy McDonald if the Blues let the speedy pivot become a free agent . . . That site also suggests that Scott Niedermayer, steaming toward retirement, could return to New Jersey for one last playoff spin. Of course, if Anaheim picks up its play, the franchise won't move into "seller" mode before the deadline . . . Wild winger Marian Gaborik is recovering from his hip surgery and hopeful of playing in March. He is headed toward unrestricted free agency, so he wants to boost his market value . . . The injury-plagued Bruins took another hit, losing winger Michael Ryder to an orbital fracture. He had revived his scoring touch after coming over from Montreal . . . Teams looking for a match-up center and face-off specialist are tracking Radek Bonk of the Predators . . . Bruins coach Claude Julien gave top youngsters Blake Wheeler and David Krejci some pine time after they lost a step. "They're no different than anyone else," Julien told the Boston Globe. "I've always said that you earn your ice time. I didn't feel those guys were good enough to have the ice time they normally have."
You know, I thought I saw this the correct way live but when it comes to night games and writing on deadline I’m never positive because so much is happening so quickly. But re-watching it confirms the spot on Pascoe’s 2-yard catch on a third-and-1 the opening drive was atrocious. Line judge Byron Boston marked the ball between the 19- and 20-yard lines — a yard and a half further than the furthest Pascoe’s forward progress took him. I’m not even positive he had the first down there. It didn’t matter because the Giants punted but Boston was right there and I can’t believe he botched that spot so badly.
The challengers accept that the federal government can legitimately seek to improve access to health care. They acknowledge that states could individually adopt virtually identical plans—as Massachusetts has—and that Congress could enact even more aggressive means of promoting universal coverage, such as extending a Medicare-type single-payer system, to all Americans. They say, however, that the particular way the Affordable Care Act is structured violates an intricate constitutional framework intended to constrain federal power by channeling it through a limited set of policy options.
Hundley hit a sacrifice fly in the first inning, an RBI triple in the third and two-run homer in the fifth off Joe Blanton (1-3).

Ferris, who later served as Michigan governor and as a U.S. senator, founded the school more than a century ago. He once said Americans should work to provide an "education for all children, all men and all women."
Periodically, county officials have tried to reform the system, but they have run into a wall of opposition from the liquor industry. Its representatives argue that changes would be unfair to those who paid so much for their licenses and that, in any case, wholesale changes aren't necessary. Typically, they agree to support legislation in Annapolis to allow a limited transfer of licenses from one district to another, releasing the political pressure without upending the system.
If the plan is approved, MetroHealth's financial burden could be reduced in two ways: First, millions in Medicaid dollars would help pay for care that the health system now provides at a discount or for free.
The party also appears to be making little progress in its effort to diversify its field of candidates; none of its major contenders for statewide office this year are women, and the GOP establishment is backing only white men. Strategists say the party's brightest prospects include Schwarzenegger and Secretary of State Bruce McPherson for reelection; McClintock, who is running for lieutenant governor; and Steve Poizner, a Silicon Valley businessman who is a candidate for insurance commissioner.
For many people, though, these senses simply fade with age, and the loss is permanent. If that's the case for you, take steps to make eating more pleasant by eating with other people as much as possible. When eating is a social event, people often enjoy their meals more. Also, experiment with different flavors. You may be able to taste some types of food, seasonings and spices better than others. Just be careful not to put too much salt on food, as excess sodium in your diet could lead to additional health concerns.

"I must have talked to five people who said they paid Frank Russo to either get their job or keep their job," said former reporter Timothy Heider, who did good work here before his departure in 2005, reporting on several of the investigative stories mentioned above, including SAFE and the buyout boondoggle. "But none of them would go on the record. Lots of people can 'know' things, but there's that little issue of proof before you can write a story. When the feds come in and they can indict you, and indict your family, and run wire taps on you, you get a little more talkative. But a reporter can't do that."

"The Nasdaq companies tend to have a higher growth rate than the rest of the market," Lissner said. "As long as they are real companies with real earnings, a price-earnings ratio of 16 is not a bad valuation."
Repeated rounds of tax increases and reductions of salaries and pensions over the past two years have seen the country mired in a fifth year of recession and unemployment spiral to above 21 percent. The backlash has seen voters turn to smaller groups and mostly anti-bailout offshoots created by disgruntled deputies who rebelled rather than vote in favor of the measures.

The group argues that Social Security doesn't contribute to the deficit, which is incorrect. The program paid more in benefits last year than it collected in taxes, and that gap will grow over time. More importantly, by 2037, Social Security won't have enough money to pay its promised benefits, which means today's 50-year-olds are looking at a 25 percent benefit cut in their mid-70s.
The 4-3 decision reversed Eric Winfrey's guilty plea in St. Charles County Court.

Both Goerne and Andsnes are storytellers of the first-rank. This promises to be a special evening.

Underwood enjoys rage; her huge voice, both naive and muscular, is well suited to it. Her best songs have historically been in the range between fury and resentment. "Blown Away" is only her fourth album, but that number belies her concrete-hard place in the country firmament, with a combination of vocal ambition and toughness that recalls a younger Martina McBride.
HOWELL — Born at just 29 weeks' gestation and weighing in at 1.78 pounds, Mary Catherine Mulvaney was called "Miracle Mary" by the nurses in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune.
That's all fine and well if both partners are happy with the new order of things.

"You find good and bad with each of them — from political baggage to not living in the neighborhood for as long as they should, as far as I'm concerned. Living here for five, six years, and you want to represent 75,000 people? That's not good enough for me," said Grasso, who said he didn't think a renter should be able to be on the council. "Every one of them has something I don't like about them."

The Jets took their only lead with 1:20 remaining in the first half, after a 2-yard touchdown run by Sanchez gave his team a 9-6 advantage.

Davis should know. He has a track record of breaking in first-time head coaches -- seven in all -- and knows what makes a good one.

Two of Davis' first-timers went on to coach in Super Bowls -- Pittsburgh's Cowher and Arizona's Ken Whisenhunt.

Hiring an architect isn't cheap. Depending on the scope, the general rule of thumb is that you will pay anywhere from 10 to 15 percent of the construction value of your project. How much will you spend on construction costs? That depends, too, on the kind of project and the level of detail. Mike Bader said that bathrooms and kitchens, which include plumbing fixtures, custom cabinets and expensive floor coverings and tiles, can easily cost $300 a square foot. Expect to pay about $150 a square foot for more straightforward living spaces and bedrooms.

Bhutan didn't open up to outsiders until 1974, and a UTEP graduate just completed a year in Bhutan as its first international artist in residence. The school is even offering a chance to visit the real thing Dec. 29-Jan.15 for the kingly sum of $7,995 (www.admin.utep.edu/Default.aspx?tabid=70181). But as the ties grow closer, there's one Bhutanese element you're not likely to see in El Paso: colorful painted phalli that adorn the sides of buildings to ward off evil spirits.

Mercer recommended that PERS adopt the lower assumed earnings rate last July, concluding it would improve long-term benefit security by raising rates and improving the system's funded status. The PERS board decided to stick with 8 percent.
I often watch the TV show "Animal Patrol," not for the sensationalism, but to help me wrap my head around the fact that we, human beings, can say we love our pets, and starve them, allow them to be flea- and tick-infested, dehydrated, tied to a tree in severe weather, frozen to trees, bred all their lives from their first heat never knowing what human touch feels like, thrown out of cars unwanted and allowed to wander aimlessly and confused, hit by cars and left by the side of the road, taught to attack just because their owner thinks it's macho, puppies and kittens acquired only because they're cute, households with pets living in their own feces.
"As soon as he told me how important this work was, its importance to the Ethiopian people, I wanted to do the right thing," Weiner says. "I wanted the book to be back where it belonged, honoring the man who owned it."
Congress will have to approve changes to the tax code, and passing such sweeping legislation could be difficult in an election year. But some of the tax breaks Obama will target expire at the end of the year -- along with the George W. Bush-era tax cuts -- providing impetus for action, possibly when Congress returns late in the year after November's elections.
If the answer is, we want to do both things, or rather we want to accomplish the former by means of the latter, then I would answer that it isn't necessary to make people thinner to improve their health -- which is a very good thing, given that we don't know how to make people thinner.
1006 Stonybrook Drive
The Cavaliers suffered their worst home loss in the franchise's 42-season history, falling, 114-75, to the Chicago Bulls in front of 17,871 fans. The 39-point margin of defeat eclipses the old mark of 35 set twice, most recently on March 20, 2001, against the New York Knicks (110-75).
"There's a growing understanding of the importance of these issues that weren't there two years ago," he said. "In these times of shrinking budgets, and federal cutbacks and state cutbacks, you can't have a big budget. This is a high-impact, low-cost approach to affect the wellness of the community."

The homicide of Champion deserves justice. This is not justice by any stretch of the imagination.
Burned out by his work in the South, Evans took a job as a writer and editor with Time Magazine and, later, Fortune magazine. But it was during this time that he produced one of his great projects -- although it wasn't published until 1966, years after the photos were shot. The so-called "Subway Series" is made up of penetrating portraits of average New Yorkers riding underground, caught by a camera Evans kept hidden under his coat. It is a reflection of something Evans wrote in 1960: "Stare. It's the way to educate your eye. Stare, pry, listen, eavesdrop."
Lewis was moved to intensive care.
"Brandon threw well," Stewart said. "He located the ball and threw a good game. There was a lot of consistency today."

øTAKIN' IT EASY: For their first-ever Fest appearance, country-rock titans the Eagles opened with a near-a capella version of Seven Bridges Road to send the message that their gorgeous harmonizing voices were still intact as they entered their fifth decade of performing. Then a countrified guitar line arose during the intro to How Long and it was clear the instrumental chops were still functioning as well. The group followed that opening with two hours of hits from their vast catalog, most done in arrangements familiar to the fans. A Spanish-inflected trumpet solo led into Hotel California, but that was about as out-of-the-box as it got. Early highlights included Peaceful Easy Feeling, I Can't Tell You Why and Witchy Woman, and they closed the show with an encore of their first hit, Take It Easy.

Best foreign baseball spot: Koshien Stadium, Osaka, Japan. Forget the sterile Rogers Centre in Toronto, home of the Blue Jays. The best foreign baseball park is across the Pacific in Japan. Koshien Stadium, built in 1924, is the home field of the Hanshin Tigers. How old is that? Its layout was modeled on the Polo Grounds in New York City. Ruth once played an exhibition game there. The stadium is considered hallowed ground by baseball fans in Japan, where the sport truly is the national pastime. Damaged by the 1995 Kobe earthquake, the stadium could have been torn down. Instead it has been given a seismic retrofitting that has stripped a bit of the old-time charm but kept the icon in business. The signature ivy on the exterior had to be pulled down for the repairs. It's being replanted, and in the meantime, ivy is painted on the scaffolding surrounding the stadium.
Moreover, the powerful trade group for the health insurance industry is certain to oppose the effort again. In past years, the group, America's Health Insurance Plans, has successfully defeated all efforts to remove antitrust protection.

El Al has it right. They profile to the “max,” interview each passenger twice and search their luggage both via scanner and by hand, in some cases. The downside is you have to be at the airport three hours before flight time. That's a very small price to pay for literally the best security in the world . . . That is unless you are deemed to be one of the “bad guys”, and then further questioning is conducted.

If one person's experiences were enough to prove that healthy habits ensure a long and vigorous life, Hempel would be the toast of the medical community. Through a mix of wise choices, natural inclination and random chance, she seems to have followed just about every bit of standard advice on living to a healthy old age -- and has achieved impressive results. Of course anecdotal evidence only goes so far, and not everybody is equally lucky. But to some extent, Hempel has created her own luck.

Raw milk is unpasteurized, meaning it hasn't been heat-treated to kill pathogens. Under Minnesota law, it can be sold directly to consumers only on the farm where it's produced. Advocates say it's easier to digest and contains beneficial enzymes that pasteurization destroys. But public health experts say there's little nutritional difference between pasteurized and unpasteurized milk and untreated milk contains harmful bacteria, such as E. coli, salmonella, listeria and campylobacter, that can cause stroke, kidney failure, paralysis or death.

Unfair? If so, the left should specify what heavier tax burden on the wealthy or lighter tax load on the lower half of taxpayers would trigger "fairness." "Fairness" hardly involves augmenting tax revenues, either for debt relief or even the social spending that makes liberals salivate.

A: Aside from the fact that it's illegal? That's like saying, "Aside from that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you like the play?" I'm sure many people copy CDs checked out from the library because it's impossible for the library to know whether a CD has been copied. But it definitely is a violation of copyright law. The Recording Industry Association of America - which, by the way, you don't want to mess with - says that it's OK to copy a CD for personal use only if "the copy is made from an authorized original CD that you legitimately own." Checking out a CD from a public library doesn't qualify.

"The Kid With a Bike" is another empathetic film by Jean- Pierre and Luc Dardenne, the brothers from Belgium who have strong sympathy for alienated children and young people, and who avoid melodrama and sensation in telling their stories so movingly. There are two things that could go seriously wrong in young Cyril's life, but they don't quite happen. The Dardennes don't wring us out like that. They prefer the drama of ordinary life, in which for a boy like Cyril things don't easily go right. In straightforward, realistic scenes, they show a boy who fears he has been thrown away, but persists in feeling that his father only lost him and will be happy to find him again.

Aardman, those meticulous Brits who build clay models and painstakingly animate them into Wallace & Gromit cartoons and the hit "Chicken Run," tip their hand that way with "The Pirates! Band of Misfits."

"It seems like the city is really starting to get behind the team," he said.
Some of us -- OK, me -- still sold Masterson short last year. Not in predicting he'd have trouble repeating his delivery at his size for nine innings though that was part of it.

The pay-per-view contests weren't picked up by any of the networks that televise Big 12 games, so the only way they can be shown is on PPV because the conference's TV contracts prohibit its members from placing games on stations that compete with the league's TV partners.

The other argued intentional battery and relied heavily on medical testimony from St. Charles County Medical Examiner Mary Case and Ann DiMaio, an emergency room physician at Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center in charge of child abuse forensics.

There was no fight or disagreement and I realize that maybe these friendships of 30 years have simply run their course. Maybe my illness was too close to home for them and they didn't like facing our mortality?
3. Kenneth Faried, Denver: The scouts took notice of Faried at Morehead State, where he broke Tim Duncan's modern-era (post-1973) record with 1,673 career rebounds, but few expected him to move so effortlessly into the pros. He's a whirlwind of relentless desire and improving post-up skills, clearly evident in his 27-point, 17-rebound game against the Warriors this month. His on-court attitude: "Kill. We're not friends.

But I don't think a single trade at the March 15 deadline, or the sudden willingness of the Blazers to play hard and scratch their way into the No. 8 seed in the Western Conference, will fix a thing. It's all fool's gold until Allen makes a declarative move that suggests he's interested in making one good, fair, final run at possibly winning an NBA championship. So, Paul?

Diagnostic tests available include pH monitoring either with a catheter down the nose or with an innovative wireless device placed in the esophagus. In select cases, special X-ray studies using a dye to illustrate the anatomy or plumbing of the upper tract may be beneficial. We also may perform an upper endoscopy exam to visualize the tissue and, if needed, take biopsies to further define the cause and extent of disease. Biopsies are especially useful in patients with an allergic predisposition such as asthma, allergies, eczema or a family history of gastro-esophageal reflux disease.

Salt Fork State Park near Cambridge -- at 17,229 acres, the state's largest -- is expected to draw the most immediate interest from oil and gas companies. For one thing, the state owns the mineral rights under most of this park, which isn't the case at many of the state parks (and when the state doesn't own the mineral rights, it can't lease them to oil companies).

The Town Hall meeting comes in the midst of a modest artistic renaissance for Warwick. In her fifth decade in the music industry, she’s been applying her classic voice to styles of music that she’s previously drawn from, but never fully embraced. The stirring “Why We Sing,” released in 2008, is the purest gospel album in her catalog. Likewise, “Only Trust Your Heart,” released earlier this year, is her first true jazz set. Devoted to interpretations of Sammy Cahn materia, it’s a relaxed tour through the songbook of a classic American tunesmith (“If You Can Dream,” “The Second Time Around”). The performances as so assured that it’s a little hard to believe that Warwick wasn’t already a fan of Cahn.

After a cup of the stuff was slid my way and I took some sips, I began to feel that Baijiu was more than just a drink. It was Beijing in a bottle.

Casa de Mi Padre is at its best (a relative term, mind you) when it's at its silliest and most surreal: the appearance of a mystical white mountain lion, who offers Ferrell's Armando sage counsel - and who is one of the least convincing animatronic puppets to come down the pike since comedian Soupy Sales conversed with White Fang - provides sublime guffaws. So, too, does a trippy dream sequence, with dolls, puppets, strobes, and a David Lynchian tableau.

What would make anticipating pride so much better than anticipating shame in controlling temptation? One reason is that pride focuses attention on the self (not the cake) and on success rather than failure. Shame, on the other hand, emphasizes the opposite; it focuses attention on the object of desire and the act of succumbing, making resistance harder to pull off. Simply put, anticipating pride makes us feel good, and anticipating shame makes us feel bad.

However, the weighty look of the space, which includes the rough timber ceiling, rusty-looking air ducts and a see-through metal grid separating the wine rack and the upstairs lounge, certainly has the rustic heft to go with Birnbaum's food. He's a guy who hails from Louisiana, where he worked with Paul Prudhomme, and spent a decade as the chef-owner of Catahoula in Calistoga.

That's why it was both amusing and unsettling when Bryant made his first field goal with 7:30 left in the fourth quarter to cut the Hornets' lead to 75-67. Bryant caught a pass from Pau Gasol from the left elbow, nailed a 17-foot jumper and prompted everyone at Staples Center to go berserk as if the Black Mamba had never made a shot in his life. Converting a contested layup that reduced the Hornets' lead to 77-69 with 6:24 left created a similar reaction, while Bryant pumped his fist with delight. And there was sure a sense of irony when "M-V-P" chants reigned over Staples Center as he hit one of two free throws to slice the gap to 79-76 with 4:24 left.

There is a solution. First, the U.S. economy needs to get moving. One element of that is to unclog the housing market, which is causing nationwide sluggishness. People who can't sell their homes because they owe more than they're worth are people who can't go where the jobs are. A plan to cut mortgage balances by giving banks a path to recover their losses in the future is very promising.

They understood that students rarely had high expectations placed before them. They felt apathy in the building.

Apple's domestic tax bill has piqued particular curiosity among corporate tax experts because though the company is based in the United States, its profits -- on paper, at least -- are largely foreign. While Apple contracts out much of the manufacturing and assembly of its products to other companies overseas, the majority of Apple's executives, product designers, marketers, employees, research and development and retail stores are in the United States. Tax experts say it is therefore reasonable to expect that most of Apple's profits would be American as well.

Now he wears Arab garb his father would never think of wearing. Habibi said he had a change of heart three years ago as he began to take his faith more seriously and found a new pride in his Muslim culture and community.
The next New York area rapper to make himself a major player: All the buzz surrounded A$AP Rocky, who has been burning up the Internet with a laid-back, menacing delivery that owes as much to Texas hip-hop as it does to rap from his native Harlem. He backed up the hype at the MTV Woodie Awards with a strong performance that featured a guest appearance by Schoolboy Q, another net-rap favorite. But although no real hip-hop fan wants to hear this, Rocky's performance had very little on the the delirious turn by pop-rap combo Chiddy Bang. Newark-raised emcee Chidera "Chiddy" Anamege might swerve around weighty topics, but he's witty even when he's being silly, and his flow is quite a bit tighter than has been reported by hardcore purists. That's especially true in concert. Last spring, he had the kids at Bamboozle going crazy; it's good to see that his magic works in the Lone Star State, too.
This change was a long time coming. For decades, the Times has been reaching north and east from St. Petersburg. Nearly 25 years ago, we launched our Tampa edition; on a typical Sunday, it routinely sells more than 100,000 copies. By a wide margin, the Times is Florida's favorite newspaper.
By now the house is filling up, and the sound has improved dramatically. The vocals are still crisp, and suddenly the drums are too. By the time Bon Jovi starts, everything should be worked out, and ready to go.

There is no reason that the U.S. shouldn't be energy independent in 10 years. Yes, we would have to drill some more, but as Peter Morici points out ("Obama's bad bet," April 3), we would manage the environmental issues much better than others. The geopolitical and economic upside would be enormous.

"I really try to preach grinding it out," he said. "Don't let it get to you. Forget that (bad) shot and go to the next shot. Obviously, I want to see the girls go for par on every hole. But once you take a shot away from having any chance of a par on a hole, figure out how you can get a bogey on a hole. Bogey is not a bad score, especially for girls golf."

By June, Plybon was on the Hornet during the Japanese attack on Midway, where the U.S. Navy decisively defeated the Imperial Japanese Navy.
The one thing that hasn't changed much is the focus on wine. Many are offered by the half bottle, and during the summer the list includes lots of rose. The chef pairs each menu item with a glass of rose, but many don't seem to work. For example, the Regaleali Rose d'Almerita that came with the slippery pappardelle pasta in garlic-lemon cream ($9.50 starter/$18.50 main course) clashed so terribly that it was undrinkable.

The debate is more about who would own and build it -- either Moroun (who wants to build a replacement span next to his privately owned Ambassador) or a public consortium of Michigan, Ontario and the U.S. and Canadian federal governments, which hope to hire a contractor to build a new bridge in southwest Detroit near Zug Island. That plan is called the New International Trade Crossing.

Given the apparent popularity among voters of laws such as the Legal Arizona Workers Act, which created employer sanctions for hiring illegal immigrants, and SB 1070, the state's controversial immigration law, why raise these concerns? Simply put, experience and empirical research show laws like these have not worked well anywhere they've been tried. By "worked," I mean in terms of outcomes, costs and impacts.
The president's plan also takes a shot at long-term unemployment: Companies would get a $4,000 tax break for hiring people who have been unemployed for more than six months. As of August, the government says, 43 percent of unemployed Americans have been out of work for six months or more.

_ "Another Earth" (2011): I saw this at Sundance in 2011 and was completely mesmerized by its low-budget, idea-driven premise, which, like the best sci-fi, uses an alternative, near-future reality to provide a unique perspective on who we are now. Mike Cahill's powerful direction of a clever, haunting script by the movie's beautiful, unknown lead, Brit Marling, along with an emotional but restrained performance by William Mapother, make this a deeply resonant film about grief and redemption.
“We’re in that situation to win and I let the team down two days in a row,” Guerra said.

We did talk to a dentist who suggested that if you do try an over-the-counter teeth whitener, to make sure you include your dentist in the conversation so you can get proper guidance. There are sensitivity issues with some people and also a dentist can better direct where the whitening agent needs to be applied. Also, the dentist we talked to, Dr. Denton Kimbrough, said people with deep-seated staining of the teeth from years of coffee or cigarettes probably will not be helped by an over-the-counter teeth whitening product.

British banks, including Lloyds, could be forced to pay customers billions of pounds in compensation over the mis-selling of payment protection insurance that was supposed to cover the repayment of people's loans if they experienced a fall in income because of illness or job loss.

"Instead of building monumental medical buildings in outer-ring suburbs in order to 'compete with the best,' the administration and management of MetroHealth Medical Center might meet the needs and expectations of county taxpayers by developing innovative ways to deliver reasonable health care in the heart of the city and at the same time maintain employment for those who are deplete and in need of jobs."
Kennedy, though, seemed to wonder aloud if a more blanket rule – one that would allow strip-searches of all those brought into the walls of the jail, for any offense — would be a fairer way and more equitable way of “protect(ing) the individual dignity of the detainee.”
It's one thing for the Illinois High School Association to question if defensive end Charles Tigue lives within the boundaries of District 189, and another for the Association to investigate the transfers of quarterback Lamontiez Ivy (from Cahokia) and running back Anthony Pierson (from St. Louis Gateway Tech), but what justifies Coach Darren Sunkett spouting off about his opposition?

Those boxes are often like mini time capsules of 20th-century American retailing and culture: at one end of the spectrum we have the carved wooden, hand-painted Nativity set and old glass ornaments that have been in the family for generations; other packages contain more "modern" accoutrements, including 1960s Styrofoam angels, silk poinsettias and Melmac serving bowls. The newest cartons are filled with contemporary decorations such as SpongeBob or Rams ornaments and made-in-China light strands which never seem to last more than two or three years.

On Jan. 28, the Dania Beach Vintage Motorcycle Show will celebrate the love of motorcycles (without the crime and death) at an event now in its sixth year in the beachside town south of Fort Lauderdale. The weather in January is dandy for riding, with temperatures hopefully not venturing into the sticky, summery realm of the high 80s and 90s.
What has changed, but not as much as I'd have imagined, is the food. For the last few months, Jason Travi, who has worked at Spago, La Terza, Fraîche and is now corporate executive chef for Best's restaurant group, has been tweaking the menu at Firefly. Though most of the dishes are new, they're all in the same rustic Mediterranean mode established by former chef Gary Menes. If anything, they're more generic than Menes' graceful originals were. (Menes left to open Palate Food & Wine in Glendale and now is looking to open his own place.)
The current solar storm, sparked by a super-sized solar flare Tuesday night, hasn't lived up to its billing. It was expected to give Earth's atmosphere at least a moderate pummeling.

One of the biggest reasons The X Factor is such a hit in The United Kingdom is the judging panel. Over seven seasons, judges have consisted of Simon Cowell, Sharon Osbourne, Dannii Minogue (Kylie Minogue’s sister), Cheryl Cole (we will discuss later), and others you probably don’t know. The chemistry, and sometimes lack thereof, between the judges is one of the elements that makes The X Factor what it is.

And there are the financial rewards: Most doctors, and/or the clinics and hospitals they work for, are paid more if they do more.

He has finished in the top four on five occasions, including a tie for third in the Masters, and in the nine tournaments he has played around the world, he has been out of the top 25 only when he tied for 29th in the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral. ... The Englishman is playing this week in the Wells Fargo Championship for the fourth time and has yet to perform at his best on the course at Quail Hollow. He shot 73-78--151 to miss the cut by five strokes in 2006, tied for 61st the following year and tied for 38th when he returned after a three-year absence in 2010. He has not broken 70 in any of his 10 rounds on the course in Charlotte. Because of his U.S. commitments, he did not defend his title in the Ballantine's Championship last week in South Korea. ... While Westwood wants a title in the Masters and the Green Jacket that goes with it more than anything, he has had more than his share of titles in some of those other Masters tournaments. His second consecutive title in the Indonesian Masters was his 11th victory, among his career total of 37, in which the tournaments has the word Masters in the title. He also has won the Volvo Scandinavian Masters twice, the Quinn Direct British Masters, the Portugal Masters, the Volvo Masters Andalucia, the Canon European Masters and the Sumitomo VISA Taiheiyo Masters three times.

A condition in which the sutures close too early, called craniosynostosis, has been associated with early fontanelle closure. Craniosynostosis results in an abnormal head shape and problems with normal brain and skull growth. Premature closure of the sutures may also cause the pressure inside of the head to increase. The condition can be diagnosed by physical exam, but often X-rays or a CT scan is required to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any other abnormalities.

HEADLINE in the Brand Expaper, referring to the warm and sunny S.F. weather: "Summer Takes One Last Shot." Written by an auslander, obviously. Summer here is cold and foggy. What was happening last wk. was typical S.F. November weather ... Brand Ex and the better newspapers blamed the low voter turnout last wk. on "a lack of big issues." What a laugh.

Do you see any thematic connection between your work in documentaries and your work in fiction films? In all my films, I'm interested in larger-than-life characters. But in documentaries, I'm trying to take the chaos of real life and make it as compelling as fiction, while in fiction films, I'm trying to make a made-up story seem like reality.

3) Early lead. It’s not a stretch to say that every team enjoys taking an early lead as it allows them to control the game’s tempo and be patient on offense. But ESPN analyst and former Johns Hopkins All-American goalkeeper Quint Kessenich said jumping out early would be more beneficial for the Blue Jays than Loyola. “I think the early lead is extremely important because Johns Hopkins as a team has proven that they’re not built to come back from behind,” Kessenich said. “They’re just not that quick on defense. You saw them fall behind Navy and when Navy spread them out and attacked them with their quick players, Hopkins lacked a certain quickness on defense. If the Blue Jays fall behind, that does not cater to their defensive strengths.”

Midtown wouldn't yet qualify as a success story by revitalization standards in New York or Chicago. The 2-square-mile collection of smaller neighborhoods north of downtown still has vacancies and lacks the bustling, thriving feel of some of those larger cities' neighborhoods in transition.

In class, she studied the issue of rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Then she worked on the Institute's exhibit, "Congo/Women: Portraits of War," which examined the scourge of sexual violence against women and toured 20 U.S. cities. The experience put academic theory into action, she said. The Institute "showed me that being quiet isn't going to make change. You have to use your voice out in the world."
There’s kink, but no real kick, to this story of Freud, Jung and the birth of psychoanalysis, and their arguments over sexy patient Keira Knightley. Give Knightley points for being unashamed — of her nudity, or her overacting — but while Viggo Mortensen is a surprisingly droll Freud, Michael Fassbender is dull at Jung, and the whole thing feels a little dusty. “A Dangerous Method” may be David Cronenberg’s most accessible film. But who wants David Cronenberg to be accessible? What was always exciting about him was his utter, difficult singularity.

That day appears to be coming.
Geoffrey Stone's lengthy commentary can be summarized quite simply: Judicial activism to overturn a law is appropriate when it promotes liberalism and inappropriate when it promotes conservatism. Why is this so?
All that notwithstanding, it is a strange time in history for self-appointed advocates for women to feel oppressed on their behalf. They must have missed the growing literature on "The End of Men" and similar themes. Women earn about 60 percent of bachelor's and master's degrees, and are reaching parity with men in medical and law schools. Their attitudes to work are changing. In a historic reversal, more young women ages 18 to 34 (66 percent) than young men (59 percent) say high-paying work is one of the most important things or very important, according to a new Pew survey.

Meanwhile, Hank and Wu are tracking down leads back in Portland. After calling on Holly's distraught mother, Hank finds out that there's a link between the forest area and a former neighbor of Holly's. You don't need to be Monroe to know that this smells suspicious -- especially since the suspect, Addison, looks so guilty when Hank calls on him. Even more suspicious, Addison had an alibi the day Holly disappeared -- he had been bitten by a wild dog hiking on Mount Hood and was in the hospital. Ah, but what hospital? Beaverton Community Hospital! Why drive all the way to Beaverton when you're in terrible pain, Hank wonders. Poor Beaverton -- dissed again.

It just seems inevitable: The ESPNers have already dug out all the numbers that illustrate how the Knicks are far better without Amar’e than they are with him (irrefutable, at least statistically), and how Melo is more effective lined up at the power forward spot that Stoudemire was supposed to have nailed down for five years.

I think that's something that's under-publicized, and we're real proud of it. As for the No. 2 seed, it's where the committee put us. We would've accepted wherever they put us, and we would've put our noses down and went to work. So that's exactly how we're going to approach it."

"Body of Lies" could very well finish in first place, but the audience surveys suggest it's hardly a lock to claim the No. 1 position. Three of the surveys estimate that the DiCaprio-Crowe film will open to $13 million to $19 million. The three surveys put "Quarantine" between $7.5 million and $16 million, but genre films often exceed their tracking estimates, especially those released by the marketing wizards at Screen Gems.

Space, whose son has diabetes, also supports stem cell research and said the government should "support, not inhibit" the technology, but that it "has an obligation to regulate research facilities to ensure that embryonic stem cells are handled in a dignified, responsible and ethical manner."
Clooney wisely recognized that the triggering action of Willimon's play involving a clandestine meeting wasn't large enough for a big-screen narrative. (Truth be told, the trust-breaking event wasn't substantial enough for the stage either, but in the theater, the piece found momentum through its Machiavellian banter.) The solution to a problematic plot, however, isn't more plot. Clooney and his fellow writers keep adding to the store of incidents in an attempt to magnify Gosling's character's interior journey when they should have reworked the story from scratch. The result is a polished piece of filmmaking that's marred by the unshapliness of its morality tale.

1. The best thing the Rams could do was accumulate as many picks as possible in the first three rounds. And that's even after they picked up three No. 1s and a No. 2 from the Redskins in exchange for moving down four spots in the first round. Why collect premium draft picks? Does that really require an explanation? If this isn't the least talented team in the NFL, it's close. The Rams roster is a disaster area, as one might conclude after noting the team's 15-65 mark since 2007, the worst five-year record in NFL history.

I have liked so many movies in every genre. But when people ask me this question, I always say, "The Grapes of Wrath." If I'm going to pick a favorite movie, I'm going to pick a classic.

The celebration should have and could have been grander had the Tigers gotten involved, Caple writes. But for some reason, a team that pays loving tribute to Tiger Stadium throughout its current stadium didn't bother to lift a finger to celebrate the 100th birthday of a field where it played for 88 years.
Obama agreed to exempt the first $5 million of a deceased person's estate, and to tax the rest at 35 percent. Congressional Democrats had expected a 45 percent tax rate on anything above $3.5 million. Without congressional action, the estate tax will revert to an even higher rate: 55 percent on estates valued above $1 million. That should have strengthened Obama's hand when negotiating with Republicans, Van Hollen said.

The quake's effects on their families and all San Franciscans reverberated for months after the 508-city-block fire was finally halted at Van Ness Avenue. When Martin returned home, hundreds of the 235,000 newly homeless were camped on their hillside. Night and day, the displaced watched the conflagration below, transfixed by the spectacle. Rose's mother took in two pregnant women, midwifed several births and shared the family's well water. Rose's youngest sister, Josephine, delivered milk from the family cow to Tent City mothers with babies. Josephine, who was 11, recorded her memories of the quake decades later:

Much of the ensuing reaction was stoked by WNST -- Jones went on to single them out for their part in "Free the Birds," -- but what their hosts expressed was echoed by plenty of people I spoke to.

Many of the town's older homes, says Murphy, an agent with Bradley Real Estate, are in the downtown neighborhoods of Deer Park and Cascade Canyon. Located on the downtown flats near the lumber company, Fairfax has some vintage homes as well.

The destination's not bad, either. You can rough it at Bright Angel Campground (if you can call access to restrooms, drinking water, telephones and a beer hall "roughing it") or sleep in a real bed in a cabin or dorm room.

He and his wife were regulars at the peach-brick Catholic church in tiny Rio Grande City. When the city needed a favor, the mayor said, "I could always just pick up the phone and call Rey." The county judge, a close friend, said, "You couldn't ask for a better person."
That would bump the already robust 1.75 percent income tax rate to 2.25 percent, generating an estimated $6 million more per year. Shaker gives a slight credit to those who work in another city and pay income taxes there. If you work in Cleveland and pay the 2 percent there, for example, you pay another 1.25 percent to Shaker. That ranks the income tax tab for Shaker residents among the highest in the region, even before a new tax.

"Feast of Love" is slim pickings, even though it was adapted from a respected novel by Charles Baxter -- why do I smell a potboiler behind the admiring book reviews? -- was directed by Robert Newman and stars Morgan Freeman, Jane Alexander and Greg Kinnear. The promise of the screen version, set in an Oregon town where everyone knows everyone else's business, is a celebration of love in many forms, enlivened by the celebrants' foibles. What passes for the movie's reality is interlocking episodes of ersatz ecstasy and angst -- a Cupid-governed "Crash" -- plus snippets of wisdom dispensed by Mr. Freeman's character, who serves as the town's coffee-shop philosopher. At one point he tells a love-struck friend, "I think I'd proceed with caution." I'd proceed just as cautiously to the movie.

He hired Frederick Olmsted's civil engineer, James Greenleaf, to design what was one of the earliest and most prominent examples of lagoon landscaping, with interconnecting canals and lakes providing the estate's water. Two million trees and shrubs were planted, and 35 fountains modeled after those Mr. Duke saw in Europe were installed.
At the time, PDC officials faced growing pressure to find money for cost overruns on the tram project. With the real estate market on an unprecedented upswing, though, PDC had money. So, the city in 2006 revised its 2003 contract. The city, developers and OHSU all committed to boosting their share of public works projects. The tram was funded and built. The park and streetcar were funded and built, even though both projects -- priorities for developers -- had been scheduled to come after the first low-income apartments.

A similar device might have helped keep the dizzying array of characters straight. When a lumbering George Clooney first appears as Bob Barnes, we could use a tag saying that he's a CIA operative who's lost his cool from being left out in the cold too long and, as his expanding waistline attests, needs to stop gorging on French fries. For Matt Damon, it could read opportunistic energy expert who backs a reform-minded member of a royal family in an oil-rich Persian Gulf country instead of his malleable idiot brother, the favorite of American business interests.

Gomer Pyle might have been about as competent an equity strategist as he was a marine. While the knee-jerk reaction to a positive earnings surprise is often, well, positive, gains can be fleeting.

PW: Not a single whale was killed while we were there last year. The reasoning on the part of the Faroese was rather funny: They said, Well, if we don’t kill any whales, then you’re not going to have a TV show. So we’re not going to kill any whales. They forgot that our show’s about not killing whales. So we were quite happy with that outcome.
On top of these come new events, such as the Canton Marathon, set for its first running June 17, 2012. "We knew we already had a base," said race co-founder Stephen Mears. "We've been looking at the trend for several years now."
When Petro campaigned for the state legislature, he said he believed in the death penalty. And when he supported the 1981 bill, he argued that the government should not bear the expense of incarcerating the most heinous criminals when they deserve to die. In short, he said that he believed the state would save money by adopting the death penalty and that the law would become a deterrent.

Which is why Caffe Roma deserves some kind of civic medal. Up until 1999, the general consensus was that if you didn't have indigestion by the time you left Room 101, you certainly would after eating lunch around there.

Advocates state that the gas tax is needed because our aging transportation system is crumbling. To be sure, congestion has grown, but are our roads crumbling as a result? Not according to the Federal Highway Administration's annual highway statistics report. In fact, FHWA shows the percentage of Maryland highways and bridges that are "structurally deficient" or "functionally obsolete" is less than it was in the mid-1990s. The perception of crumbling roadways is often unquestioned because of the I-35 Minnesota bridge collapse, yet federal investigators attributed this tragedy to be caused by faulty design, not under-investment in maintenance.

Sanchez's 1-yard run gave the Jets a score on their first drive, as New York got off to the type of quick start it has been lacking most of this season.

There was really no reason for Brady’s first interception. He should’ve seen Boley underneath. He did a good job of waiting for Branch to clear Kiwanuka but didn’t realize that second window had closed as well. Later, he nearly threw a second interception to Grant when he didn’t see him lurking underneath. The Giants played the second level of their defense close to the line for much of the game. I wonder if part of the thinking there was, in addition to providing run support, it would disguide the LBs and DBs down low who were dropping underneath routes. Regardless of how it was done, it was clear a big part of the Giants’ defensive game plan was to help cover routes underneath up the middle of the field as a defense against Welker and the TEs. And they executed it fantastically.
Counter-terrorism experts also suggest the assassination plot may be linked to an internal power struggle in Tehran between President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei, who wields ultimate control over the Quds force. Given the high level of professionalism of most previous Quds operations, the clumsy way this plot was carried out — almost as if it were intended to be discovered — has led to speculation that it could even have been a deliberate attempt by the Khamenei faction to embarrass President Ahmadinejad and undermine his authority. In the wilderness of mirrors that characterizes Iran's fractured political structure, it may prove impossible to figure out the motivation of all the various players or the rationale behind their actions.

Down the list a little bit is Matt Holliday. The Cardinals' left fielder has 1,294 hits at the break, and according to the Toy he has a 11 percent chance of ripping that 3,000 career hit before he's done. Lance Berkman has 1,753 career hits and does not crack the list on James' Toy. Berkman made an interesting point in the dugout the other day when talking with me about Jeter's 3,000. He said it's unlikely for a slugger to reach that number anymore - not because of consistency or quality of play. Simply, they don't get enough at-bats. Sluggers are walked too much to crack out 3,000 hits, and once Rodriguez gets there then it will be awhile before the next "slugger" reaches the mark. That could be Pujols, Berkman said.

Yet the food DePersio serves at Fascino is nothing like the familiar Italian food at so many Jersey restaurants. This food is lighter, and it's not just that the heavy sauces are gone. This is a European renaissance. DePersio brings French techniques to Italian food, and the result is something elemental and transcendent, with a gnocchi, for example, that seems to defy the laws of physics. Perhaps this is what DePersio meant when he named the place -- you will be fascinated by his ability to take a basic dish and elevate it to an ethereal version of itself.

The Quakes and their double rooting brigades - the chanting Ultras and the drum-beating Casbah - couldn't be more delighted.
Moscoso's résumé works in his favor. He started 21 games last season for Oakland, so he won't be evaluated solely on spring training. Chatwood received a baptism by blowtorch last season with the Angels. If Rockies players were asked to pick the last starter, they'd go with Chatwood because his stuff is electric. But that also could translate into a power arm in the bullpen.

A: Well, he is still dead. But no, what happened was I was sitting at a restaurant and looked across and saw a tabloid newspaper with the headline "James Brown is dead," so I took that, the same font and everything, and just cut it out of these billboard papers. But my thought was, which James Brown? There was the Little Richard James Brown, the I'm-Black-and-I'm Proud James Brown, there was the crackhead James Brown. There've been so many James Browns, I thought, "Which one?"

This is why I believe the first step following the 2003 invasion of Iraq should have been the privatization of the oil fields. If the government had given every individual over 21 equal shares in a corporation that had the right and responsibility to make appropriate arrangements with foreign oil companies for the purpose of discovering and developing Iraq's oil reserves, the oil income would have flowed in the form of dividends to the people - the shareholders - rather than into government coffers.

Wind energy will one day play a significant role in America's energy future, as will other renewables. But that day will not come anytime soon, for it takes years to acquire approvals and permits, secure financing and build the infrastructure. America's oil and natural gas companies believe in alternative energy, and that is why they are investing billions of dollars in developing the technologies that will get us to a green energy future. But they are also working to make certain that Americans have the energy they need in the meantime.

Tim Brown, Yahoo! Sports: "The contract came from the usual mist of a Boras free-agent pitch, with franchises rumored to come and go into the final frantic moments. It would be the Washington Nationals, or the Texas Rangers, or the Baltimore Orioles, or the Seattle Mariners, or somebody, maybe even the Los Angeles Dodgers. And it came from the usual soup of a Boras winter, when the market was too thin, the years too long and the price too high. Instead, the fit was as perfect as the timing. For Fielder, he gets a relevant franchise that helps lift a city, a contender that now boasts the best three-four pairing in the game. And he gets the late-career rocking chair of the DH rule, if that's where it leads."

Ms. Suu Kyi's comments go the heart of a central question asked by international leaders—whether a range of liberalizing moves over the past year by Myanmar's government are genuine and likely to survive over the long term. Western governments are closely watching Sunday's vote, which will fill around 45 of the more than 600 seats in Myanmar's parliament, as an indicator of whether to begin easing major economic sanctions in place for years to punish Myanmar's secretive military regime. U.S. and European leaders have said they would be willing to lift some sanctions soon, possibly as early as next month, if the vote is seen as free and fair.

The significant participation of Fidel Castro's Cuba in the African independence movement of the 1960s gets a detailed look in "Cuba: An African Odyssey," while the first female president of Africa's oldest independent republic is profiled in "Iron Ladies of Liberia."

It sounds very big. I'd like to leave a legacy where some of my students — I won't say all — have love and respect for our music. That's a fundamental thing I'd like them to understand, not just a way of making a living or a lot of name, but go deep into music and keep it alive.

Lubanga, the head of a rebel militia that fought a devastating ethnic war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, on Wednesday had the distinction of being the first person convicted by the International Criminal Court, a decade-old institution that has been in equal measures an inspiration and a disappointment for human rights advocates. The guilty verdict is a milestone for the court that also marks the first time an international trial has focused solely on the recruitment of underage soldiers, which is forbidden in global treaties but is usually lumped in with other war-crimes charges. The successful prosecution of Lubanga — for enlisting boys and girls under 15, drugging them, putting them to work killing his enemies and using them as sex slaves — will set a precedent useful in future trials (including a trial of Kony, if he is ever captured).

Bullying of those who appear to be different from the group, and especially those perceived to be weak, is a sad and sorry state of the human condition. It has existed across the millennia, across most cultures, and is often celebrated in America today in such forms as celebrity gossip and sleazy reality "entertainment." While we decry each publicized act of bullying, we turn our backs on a much larger cultural context, ignoring the slippery slope that often leads the most aggressive among us to seek approval from a group, or revenge against a perceived enemy by physical or verbal acts that hurt.

That's why Romney's shift to Obama's side in the president's battle with House Republicans over student loans may be his most instructive flip-flop yet. It shows that Romney will do all he can to soften his underlying radicalism. His goal is to deprive Obama of ways to reveal the concrete impact of free-market utopianism -- and the price of the cutbacks Romney embraced by endorsing Rep. Paul Ryan's budget.

It's highly unusual for a car rental company to charge an extra driver fee for a spouse, but such a surcharge isn't illegal. It is something of a money grab, though. Does it cost the car rental company more if your wife, brother or son drives your rental? No. Will your car insurance cover damage to the vehicle if it's damaged? Check with your insurance company, but I've never heard of an "extra driver" fee having any relevance in a claim that involves a driver's insurance company.

There are, of course, reasons for our wine preferences, starting with biology and gender. A Yale School of Medicine study 10 years ago indicated that 35 percent more women are "supertasters" than men. The study divided the world into supertasters, tasters and non-tasters.

The disorder is typically treated with anticonvulsants, such as lamotrigine, carbamazapine or valproate. Such drugs are effective in controlling seizures in perhaps as many as 60% of cases. But when the patient fails treatment with at least two different drugs, their epilepsy is said to be medically refractory and they are candidates for surgery. Such surgery removes the area of the brain that is misfiring and causing the seizures. Physicians typically insert electrodes into the brain to identify the source of the electrical disturbance, then remove a small amount of tissue that is involved. The most common type of procedure is called a lobectomy.

I can only fall back on the "pause button" theory I read about years ago: Go out and live life to the fullest — but before acting on an impulse, take 20 seconds and consider the implications of what could happen.

--Speaking of changing recipes, PepsiCo says it knows how to sell more Tropicana brand orange juice: Add water. Some consumers prefer orange juice that’s less thick. Others want juice with the "goodness" of oranges and fewer calories, the company says. It believes consumers will pay the same -- or more -- for such versions.

The brand lost market share last year to Coke’s Minute Maid and Simply Orange brands. So now PepsiCo is focusing on products with less juice, more innovation and, therefore, higher profit margins.

Perhaps it’s because Rolle has lost in a Super Bowl before (with the Arizona Cardinals, in Super Bowl XLIII). He’s gone through this process and come home empty-handed. He was careful not to downplay any member of the Patriots today, including the matchup nightmares of tight ends Rob Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez.

Just as I'm doubting the wisdom of having spent money to join a death march, we reach our first summit. There, awaiting us, is the greatest watermelon ever created. Cut into pieces by the guide's machete, the cool, sweet slices of goodness lay spread on wooden tables as a reward for the ascent. A small shack there also sells Gatorade, granola bars, even menthol cigarettes, for those seeking that refreshing smoky mint taste.

One strong contender with a distinguished history is Franklin's Teleme, a runny cow's milk cheese made by Franklin Peluso in San Luis Obispo. The cheese hits the market when it is only about two weeks old and continues to improve for three to four weeks. Coated in rice flour, the floppy 6-pound square is moist and buttery when young, with a sour-cream fragrance; given more age, it becomes softer and runnier and develops mushroom aromas. It's seductive at any stage.

The 150-pound fossil recovered last year in northern Kentucky is more than 6 feet long and 3 feet wide. To the untrained eye, it looks like a bunch of rocks or a concrete blob.

Obama was holding two days of meetings at the Summit of the Americas with leaders from across the vast region before heading back to Washington Sunday night.
The tour boat driver stopped about 50 yards from a picturesque islet crowned by swaying palms. The lagoon was so clear that I had no trouble spotting three black-tip sharks circling near the boat. We would have to run a gantlet to get to the alluring white beach off the bow, but no one hesitated. I plowed ahead, wading through waist-deep water, keeping a wary eye on the three fins near me. There were 13 sets of legs and only three sharks. Not bad odds. Besides, the sharks were small.

At the Biden group's last meeting Wednesday, discussions over whether to include taxes were particularly contentious, Mr. Cantor said.

We’re told that “The Hunger Games” is an Orwellian takedown of brutal authoritarian governments, that it satirizes our obsession with television and fame. One reviewer praised the early scenes (set in an impoverished West Virginia-like area) for having the quality of Dorothea Lange portraits of the Great Depression. Another praised the movie as implicitly backing the 99 percenters against the 1 percent. We’re told that the movie shows us, in metaphor, how badly we mistreat our children.

In came Stallings. Practice was in two hours, they had a team that could dominate the Missouri Valley, and he didn’t need this. If either of them knew of any assistant coach who kept his job after a DUI, the name eluded both.

The monkey's hands were very soft, very velvety as they danced over my neck and shoulders. The creature was chattering gently, right next to my ear. Then it tugged. I tugged back. The monkey tightened its grip and pulled harder. Not exactly the story I'd planned to write: Padangtegal Ubud, Bali - Primate Garrotes Writer in Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary. But there I was in the surreally mystical refuge of macaca fascicularis - the Balinese or long-tailed macaque monkey - being strangled to death by two little hands and four shiny strands of red coral.

Barbecue items are fairly standard — beef short rib, rib-eye, pork tenderloin, shrimp, calamari, tripe, etc. Kalbi (short rib) is good quality but not exceptional, and the portion seems a bit smaller than at other Korean barbecue restaurants.

As a treat for Kai, 9, we had Tun drive on without us to the next temple while we hired a horse and cart and rode to the monstrous Dhammayangyi Temple, where the king who built it was also assassinated. Then, after seeing the late 12th century Gawdawpalin Temple, we stopped at the all-white Leimyethna, a one-story temple with faded murals dating from 1223. There were no guards, no souvenir vendors, no other tourists. Robin and Kai walked through it quickly and headed back to the car, while I lingered, wanting to experience alone the nearly 800-year-old temple. I sat cross-legged in front of a giant Buddha image, closed my eyes and just listened to the silence, broken only by the buzz of a passing bee. My 10 minutes alone in the temple was a rare, heavenly experience.

No prominent Democrat has stepped forward to run against him, even as a protest. It may be that, by beginning gradual withdrawals of American combat troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, Mr. Obama has assuaged the feelings of this important segment of the party.

A: Of course. I always tried to keep a balance. It wasn't one person's story and it wasn't one side's point of view, and at the end of the day you have to listen to everybody and hear everybody but then tell a story, and you have to make some decisions that can't be that vague. You can't please everybody and you have to make decisions that you know, especially in this conflict particular, there're still people today who deny it happened and are very aggressive and hateful when the subject matter's even brought up.
Like the service, the room can be a touch abrasive. The cinderblock wall filled with a ton of empty picture frames (apparently some kind of evocation of an Italian family basement or a dive bar) is like the design-equivalent of a comedian bombing on stage.

But hormone replacement therapy (HRT) -- controversial since the 2003 Women's Health Initiative Study first linked it to higher rates of breast and ovarian cancer -- suggests an answer: Women who have taken HRT in the past were found to have brains with greater volumes of gray matter.

At a time when the middle class is vanishing, when Baby Boomers are wondering how they're going to be able to retire, when job-hunting young people who are saddled with mammoth education and government debt are protesting the clever profiteers at the top of the capitalist food chain, is it silly to ask if Tom Ricketts and Theo Epstein are appropriate heroes for the times?

Thursday's twin blasts in Damascus were the fifth in a string of major attacks in Syrian cities that have clouded the picture of a fight between the opposition and the regime.

Off they go to investigate, and we see, playing the role of Bramble Haus, the Lion and the Rose Victorian bed and breakfast inn, actually located on Northeast 15th Avenue, near Lloyd Center.

øQB: Matthew Stafford, Lions - The last time the All-Joe team selected a player who passed for more than 5,000 yards and 40 TDs was never. Despite posting such numbers and leading Detroit into postseason for the first time this century, Stafford could not snap the Lions' 40-year streak of failing to send a quarterback to the Pro Bowl. But he'll fix that soon enough. Alex Smith, 49ers - He may never be as good as the man he was drafted way ahead of (Aaron Rodgers), but his team player longer this season largely thanks to Smith's playoff heroics. After throwing a league-low five interceptions, Smith could really blossom in 2012 while playing in the same offense in successive seasons for the first time … provided San Francisco re-signs him. Tim Tebow, Broncos - Love him or loathe the hype surrounding him, there's no denying he revitalized a team that was dead in the water into AFC West champs. We especially appreciate his willingness to play wideout when Kyle Orton was still the starter.

Actually, the truth hurts. We've taken quite a fall -- one that might not be obvious as Oregon busily restructures its state education leadership and mutely slogs through another year of local school cutbacks. Somehow, our K-12 education system has come to rank among the nation's most fragile on multiple fronts.
In my 15 years covering suburban crime and justice, I’ve seen AAIM do everything from help victims pay their mortgages to compile an annual DUI survey ranking Illinois police departments.

Executive producer Veena Sud and her team wrapped up that rookie season by not wrapping up anything. It looked like Sarah's quirky and likable partner, Stephen Holder (Joel Kinnaman), had faked the crucial evidence leading to the arrest of their prime suspect, mayoral candidate Darren Richmond (Billy Campbell). And it looked like Larsen family friend Belko Royce (Brendan Sexton III) was about to gun down Richmond.

Harry O'Reilly, a retired New York City detective sergeant who headed its special victims unit and now teaches sex crime investigative tactics to law enforcement, said police might consider massage therapy somewhat of a "dubious profession," and may not follow up since the victim didn't provide details until more than two years later and it does not rise to a rape allegation.

It's well documented how poorly the Rams have done in the past on draft day. Forbes.com ranked the organization as the second-worst in draft proficiency between 2005 and 2009, and if you look back over the last decade, it's just as bad if not worse. But there is no reason to hold Snead and Fisher accountable for those messes. There's also no reason to believe that they can't produce a bounty of immediate hole-plugging talent in this draft.

So, St. Louis investors, what's next?

The half-dozen pastas include a few classics - spaghetti with seafood sauce ($18) and penne with pork Bolognese ($17) - and a soulful linguine with a meat sauce that you couldn't mistake for anything other than lamb, brightened with English peas and ricotta salata ($17).
"Wrecking Ball" is not an E Street Band album: Springsteen’s longtime collaborators hardly contribute to the recordings. Yet the musicians have embraced the new material, and at Izod Center, they backed the Boss with so much fervor that an observer would be forgiven for thinking they’d written those songs themselves.
The word Easter is co-opted from the Norsemen’s Ostara, the pagan goddess of the dawn and of spring. The Easter Bunny arose from its burrow at that time as a symbol of fertility, something that causes many of us to blush today.
Only "The King" has hit that whopping number.
First Solar said it expects to earn profits this year of $4 to $4.50 per share, up from the $3.75 to $4.25 per share previously estimated. It is building several power plants, including four massive facilities in California and Arizona.

I am required to pay into a pension system that state legislation has constantly underfunded. I am also required to pay for retiree health care that a judge ruled could be stolen at any time by this Legislature. In fact, the Legislature recently stole $1 billion in funds from the school aid fund that could have been used to make up for the lack of retirement funding from previous years. Instead, the money was used as a sort of corporate cash cow for Gov. Rick Snyder and his friends.
Getting fat has never been easier, of course. Food is plentiful and convenient, and the bad stuff is tasty and cheap. At the end of long day, it's easier to buy a Happy Meal than to shop and prepare a balanced dinner. And who wants to hear the little darlings protest when presented with cauliflower over calzone?
Among the 44 defendants arrested last year were five rabbis from New York and New Jersey — including the chief rabbi for the Syrian Jewish community in the United States — and several other Orthodox Jewish defendants.

At Metzger, she was chair of the Citizen Participation Organization and worked to protect the park. On Saturday, Metzger Park's community center will officially be renamed the Patricia D. Whiting Hall.
Positioning is important. Once the drawing is held for the top three spots, the rest of the order is determined by record and tiebreakers. The team with the third-most chances in the lottery will draft no lower than sixth, but the team with the sixth-most chances could draft as low as ninth.
And the park is constantly evolving, Roemer says, staying on top of entertainment trends to give thrill-seekers what they desire. Next month, the park will debut its newest attraction, SkyScreamer, a 236-foot tower (the tallest ride in the park) that spins guests in swings in a 98-foot circle at speeds reaching almost 45 mph.

From his deadpan tone, it's not entirely clear he's joking.
The unions sued the county last April, claiming that its move to give the County Council the final say in labor disputes violated a county charter change that voters approved in a 2002 referendum.

Of the 161 suspects indicted by the U.N. court since its establishment in 1993, only one remains on the run - Goran Hadzic, a leader of rebel Serbs in Croatia.
Developers in the Mojave Desert last month were so keen on going forward with their project that they didn't consult with Native Americans about the ancient objects that might lie underground or conduct the required archaeological work in a thorough way. This has happened before: It happened most recently in downtown Los Angeles last year at the site of one of the area's oldest burial grounds. Now it's happening again 200 miles east, in the desert.

MACON, Georgia -- A Warner Robins, Ga., grandmother shot and wounded one of two armed men who tried to rob her outside of her daughter's house on Saturday morning.
Unfortunately, recovery of auto sales could take longer. Most European countries, facing gaping budget deficits, are cutting government spending and raising taxes. Such austerity has boosted unemployment to as high as 24% in Spain and 9.8% in Italy. Although they are meant to bring more discipline, these moves have dampened consumer spending.
The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago tossed out two of Black’s fraud convictions last year, citing that landmark ruling. But it said one conviction for fraud and one for obstruction of justice were not affected by the Supreme Court’s ruling. The fraud conviction, the judges concluded, involved Black and others taking $600,000 and had nothing to do with honest services. It was, they asserted, straightforward theft.
Guerra pitched a perfect inning in the Dodgers' 6-5 loss to the San Diego Padres on Tuesday to lower his spring earned-run average to 1.35. It marked the second time he pitched on consecutive days.
“You know, we never should have been in that situation,” Reynolds said. “Chen pitched his tail off out there, and I boot that ball. That’s a play that’s got to be made. They capitalized on it, and we really couldn’t get anything going after that. It’s very, very, very frustrating.”
Something about taking found pieces and broken china and marbles and making art from it is appealing to me. "Meridian Archway" and "Gasworks Memorial Sundial" are two favorites. They are mixed media, mosaic sculptural installations. "Meridian Archway," by Chuck Greening, welcomes the visitor into the Good Shepherd Center with a path and bench of seashells, pebbles and river rock. Inside the grassy park with its old apple trees are smaller fanciful pieces that appeal to the kids, like "Let the Rumpus Begin," based on Maurice Sendak's book "Where the Wild Things Are."
Treatments are costly
And last year, it got a guilty plea and eventual consecutive life prison sentences for Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a 24-year-old Nigerian student turned Al-Qaida operative, for trying to detonate a bomb in his underwear on a Detroit-bound jetliner on Christmas Day 2009.

The menu is so involved it's hard to know where to begin, which makes me a little nervous about Terje keeping tabs on all 37 preparations. My fear is that over time the focus will lessen, but for now just about everything is excellent, including the five crudos, such as hamachi drizzled with blood
In terms of socioeconomic gaps between high schools, no other Oregon school district has the disparities that Portland does. For example, about 80 percent of Roosevelt High School current students qualify for federally subsidized meals while about 10 percent of Lincoln High School students do.
"What if our center position was like hockey?" Karl said. "Four- or five-minute stints, just run, run, run, run. Next guy, run, run, run, run. Because I know Bynum and Gasol don't want to run, run, run, run for 48 minutes."
The Hawks finished the half with 62 points - the highest point total for a Magic opponent in a first half this season and just one point shy of the highest point total by a Magic opponent in any half this season.

Q: Hey, Brian: If Dan Gilbert knew LeBron James was going to leave, would Mike Brown have been fired? Would it have led to Danny Ferry quitting? Obviously Gilbert was upset that LeBron left, but if he fired a decent head coach and lost a bright general manager as a result, then I can understand why that may have sent him over the edge. --Scott Heritage, Phoenix

Only months ago, it seemed uncertain whether Obama would get the same kind of loving embrace from Hollywood that he did in the 2008 campaign. Actor and former supporter Matt Damon in particular voiced his displeasure last year, saying the president had "misinterpreted his mandate" and that he needed guts, though he used a blunter term. will.i.am, creator of that "Yes We Can" viral video that ended with the word "HOPE," said: "I don't want to hope anymore." Even Obama's top fundraisers acknowledged the mood was more muted — unavoidably, they said — than during Obama's first campaign.
"There's never going to be a time when at least one of the facilities is not open. That was an important factor for us," said Harold Bartlett, the authority's executive secretary.
Last Friday, an emailer sent me a YouTube video and an audio file of a clip from a somewhat-obscure national talk radio show. Both purported to expose shocking facts in the labyrinthine national health care legislation that has been proposed and enacted in recent years. Some of the key claims: No family will be able to receive care totaling more than $10,000 over the course of the year. All non-citizens of the U.S. must be provided free health care.

Bencivengo’s legal troubles are expected to lead the discussion during tonight’s council meeting at 6:30 p.m. Council president Kevin Meara has placed two discussion items on the agenda in relation to the federal probe and the powers of council, which include the authority to form an investigatory body but not the power to remove an elected mayor.
When Hugh Carman, Schramm's grandfather, opened Carman's Nursery 75 years ago, he carried a full range of plants and products for home gardeners, Schramm said. Ed Carman partnered with his dad after World War II, and soon developed an interest in unusual plants. Schramm, 54, spent her childhood learning about plants from her father, a talkative plant-lover who befriended nurserymen around the globe and sparked a love of horticulture in many valley residents.

Posada de las Minas, Mineral de Pozos, Guanajuato. $83-$141. One of colonial Mexico's most prosperous mining towns, about an hour's drive from San Miguel de Allende, Mineral de Pozos was a ghost town for nearly a century before being discovered by artists, photographers and seekers of peace and solitude. The hotel, occupying a 19th century mansion, offers six rooms and two apartments, and the bar is sell-stocked with top-notch tequilas. Though the town is only just awakening from a long slumber, active types can go hiking, mountain biking or horseback riding to the nearby mines, and shoppers have plenty of local crafts to choose from. Neighboring towns make ideal day trips for travelers who want to delve deeper into Mexican history and culture.

Steamed clams ($13), along with some great fries, could also be enough to satisfy a hearty appetite. The clams are piled into a covered bowl with coins of fingerlings, chard and chunks of chorizo in a rich chowder-like cream sauce. Add some bread for dunking and you probably don't even need the fries.
The Marlins and Brewers "had some serious incentive to go out and whip somebody," he said.
The player stopped short of criticizing Marquez, a Mexican star who once played for Barcelona.

So I'm not really allowed to have an opinion."

I'm disappointed with the soup at many places, but here the combinations are so enticing I had to order it on each visit. The first time it was cream of asparagus teetering on the edge of rosemary overload; the second was sausage and farro with a rich tomato broth that was good but could have been absolutely lyrical with a little more restraint with the herbs. On my third visit, the soup was an exceptional black bean ($7) that took on the meaty character of the accompanying bits of chorizo with a swirl of chile cream and scallions in the center to smooth it all out.
Many faculty members are suspicious of the administration's willingness to subsidize athletics at a time when every UC campus is struggling to preserve academic quality, so Barsky's discovery rang alarm bells among UC faculty and staff statewide.
Since I'm rolling, let's also look at the "we" in your drama-free relationship. Granted, the survey sample is too small, but with the information given I can theorize an "I" at the heart of that situation, too: Where you and he differ, he stays put and you close the gap. Look, Ma, no drama ...

_ CAN BOBBY VALENTINE SURVIVE THE SEASON? This sure isn't what Bobby V had in mind when he returned to the big leagues. Battered bullpen, banged-up roster, mini-feud with popular Kevin Youkilis and angry crowds at Fenway Park. Many fans in Boston wondered how much worse it could get after last year's collapse. Well, last place isn't looking so great. That said, he won't be the first manager to get chopped in 2012 — that's much more likely to be Kansas City's Ned Yost. The call: Red Sox management will preach patience, Boston starts playing better and Valentine makes it through the year.

OBAMA: "On the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of collapse. Some even said we should let it die. With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen. In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We got workers and automakers to settle their differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure. Today, General Motors is back on top as the world's No. 1 automaker. Chrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company. Ford is investing billions in U.S. plants and factories. And together, the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs. We bet on American workers. We bet on American ingenuity. And tonight, the American auto industry is back."  Jan. 24 State of the Union speech.

At issue was whether that deal would be renegotiated to keep thousands of U.S. forces in Iraq. The Obama administration and Iraqi government spent months debating whether the United States would keep troops to maintain a training force, to provide added stability in a country where spectacular attacks still occur, and to serve as a hedge against Iran.

The governors' cooperation hasn't produced a headline-grabbing accord such as the one between O'Malley and McDonnell's predecessor, Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine. Those two stood side-by-side on the banks of the Potomac River in 2008 to announce a ban on harvesting blue crabs in winter months, a development that is credited with a rebound in the population.

Lloyd: I don’t know if the rest world will ever catch up to me because I don’t know where the hell I am most the time. If you notice, almost every TV commercial lately has ukulele in it. The ukulele is now being taken more seriously. It’s not a just novelty instrument or a1920’s nostalgia trip, but an important member of the string family used in classical, jazz, folk, rock, etc. I like Tiny Tim but enough of the “Tiptoe Through the Tulip” requests. That’s like a guitarist getting, “Dude, play Freebird!” (which I get as well). But it’s no surprise to me that more people are getting turned on to the pure sound of the ukulele. That’s why I love it so much - it has a weak sound but in the right hands it can sound powerful. I think because rock music relied so heavily on the guitar, you figure at some point it may have been stretched to the limit. But making folk or orchestra instruments as lead rock instruments could have endless possibilities in that genre. I hope to hear more in the future. As for the Jew’s harp, the other uke player in Lloyd United, Riri Hamilton, plays a mean one.
The company planned well ahead for the release of ultra-high-definition devices like the new iPad. Marvel, DC, and their other publishers have already been providing them with comics files rendered in more than enough detail.

The difficulty was deciding which of these fillings to make for the first night of Hanukkah. To help, I invited several neighbors over for a tasting. This proved to be fruitless, because they each preferred a different one. "Make them all," they said, laughing.

If Congress fails to extend the current payroll tax cut, taxes will go up on millions of people at a time when families are struggling to make ends meet. That's unacceptable, as a typical household earning $50,000 a year will see their taxes increase by $1,000. But if Congress passes the proposal laid out by President Obama, the typical family earning $50,000 a year would see that tax cut continued, and receive more than $500 additionally — for a total tax cut of $1,500. It makes absolutely no sense to raise taxes on the middle class at a time when so many are still trying to get back on their feet and we see positive signs in growth and falling unemployment.

I drove in Friday from the far Southwest Side because it was Opening Day for the White Sox. I drive the Dan Ryan Expy. regularly, and it just hit me - like a ball lost in the sun - what a great thing it is that the Dan Ryan was redone eight to 10 years ago, or whenever that was. What an enormous success it has been. You can drive in during rush hour at a normal clip, 30 minutes from 111th Street to Chinatown at 8 a.m. is incredible. Thanks to all those who planned and designed and had the vision to make it happen.

If you got on it early, you probably found some fun ones. I shot out at Newport Beach today, where there was some solid 4-to-5 footers in West Newport before the wind kicked up. Huntington was all jumbled and closed out, but if you headed north of the pier to the Cliffs there were some big bombs hitting. Salt Creek had size and the winds stayed down. The spot that had everyone pumped up this morning was north side Seal Beach, showing some wild overhead sets.

Within a mile, the trail separates from the creek and heads toward an old corral, a good turnaround point at about four miles from the trailhead. The trail veers to the right of the corral and heads north another mile up a ridge and then down into Jacks Gulch, but only hikers with good route-finding skills should continue as the trail turns sketchy in a few places.
Darvish only walked two batters after walking at least four in each of his previous three starts. He enjoyed plenty of success with his cut fastball, throwing 20 of 27 for strikes while recording five swings and misses. It was a particularly effective weapon against left-handed hitters. He used the pitch to get in on hitters' hands, making it easier to establish his four-seamer and two-seamer on the outer half.
It turns out that there is no unanimity of scientists supporting man-made global warming theory and never has been. It's also now becoming widely recognized that there is no incontrovertible evidence that global warming is caused by human activity, and that there is quite a bit of evidence that human activity is not a primary cause of such warming.

“It’s an ever-changing industry,” he said. “And a cyclical one. By 2003, you couldn’t find a veggie burger on a menu. By 2006, it started to make a comeback. If you don’t change, you get lost in the lurch.”
The Ohio Democratic Party says it is this: Those earlier trips appear to have been made to test the fund-raising waters for a U.S. Senate race, and should not have been funded by Mandel's state treasurer's race account.
"We're in a more pronounced recovery here," he said. GM now expects U.S. industrywide sales of 14 million to 14.5 million this year. That's still lower than the peak of 17 million in 2005, but better than the 2009 downturn, when 10.6 million new vehicles were sold.

Didn't civic leaders learn from last fall's St. Louis-centric special session, when the "China Hub" proposal failed? In the Legislature, this city has a target on its back. It's hard enough to get local leaders unified behind a project, let alone build a legislative coalition behind something important to the St. Louis region.
James is winning the award for the third time in four seasons. Only seven other players -- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan, Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and Moses Malone -- have at least three MVP trophies.

Hey, Mike and Frederick: I think the Cavs have varying amounts of interest in the players you suggest, but right now I think they're focusing on the lottery and draft to see how they can improve the team. They have stated their intention to be aggressive in an effort to use the trade exception, but I'm not sure any of those players will be made available by their teams and I doubt the Cavs can get three players of the caliber mentioned in Frederick's email.

Portland didn't muster much of an attack after falling behind so quickly. The Galaxy defenders simply sat back and allowed most balls to remain in front of them. The Timbers' best chances occurred when defender Mamadou Danso's header was deflected by Los Angeles goalkeeper Donovan Ricketts late in the first half and when a chip by Kenny Cooper inside the box was stopped by Ricketts in the 71st minute.

“Yeah, I wouldn’t call Roger a mentor,” Cameron says, laughing. “Basically he’d just come in and yell at you occasionally. But that was good too. It was all very Darwinian: put up, or shut up.

Smith had a tough time from the tour’s beginning because the sudden onset of dry weather in Moscow — coupled with construction in and around the Conservatory in which the CSO performed — stirred up much dust and made it difficult for the clarinetist to draw deep breaths. He came down with a sinus infection, then an eye infection (he said he was dousing his eyes with a rinse every half page of Franck’s Symphony in D Minor in St. Petersburg) and eventually a respiratory infection. So he appreciated the day off.

The guides were controversial all over the country, of course. Some politicians, even Democrats, thought the writers' project was a Communist plot. And as it's revealed on the title page, "Los Angeles" was co-sponsored by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, maybe we should be grateful that what we got is as good as it is. The guide remains addictively readable and features, as Kipen notes, sheaves of "dazzling monochrome photography" from the likes Julius Shulman and Fred William Carter. It's still alive and has become big history in the debate it set out to report, the one that asks the questions: What exactly is L.A., and whither goes it?

There's no way to confirm the Burtele foot is from the same evolutionary grouping as Ardi and its descendants without telltale "diagnostic" skull bones and teeth. Scientists rely on those, rather than skeletal bones, for precise genus and species identification. (The fossils don't contain DNA, ruling out genetic analysis.)
They have lost five games they led in the seventh inning. General Manager Jerry Dipoto is actively searching for relief help — “looking under every rock,” he said recently — but his most costly decision might have been during the offseason when he opted not to sign an experienced closer to replace Walden and move the hard-throwing right-hander into an apprentice role in the bullpen.
As he is in many states, Romney is well organized in Idaho and has a large number of endorsements from GOP leaders in the state. On Tuesday, Idaho Gov. Butch Otter and Sen.

Tour guide Ann Lombardi of the Trip Chicks recently watched a schemer in the Frankfurt, Germany, train station perform the classic "hollow suitcase with rollers and frame trick," which Lombardi says works thusly: "A distracted tourist takes his eyes off his bag for just a second. Behind the tourist lurks a guy with an enormous suitcase. In a flash, the thief lifts the enormous hollow luggage, puts it over the tourist's bag, and calmly wheels away the Trojan Horse with his prized catch inside."
Additionally, since your needs are not being met, you will likely find yourself more tense and irritable with him in the long run. It is not uncommon for women to quietly resent their partners for not fulfilling them, even though she is doing everything in her power to convince him that she is fulfilled. Talk about a vicious cycle! This is why lies (even the little white ones) have no place in your relationship.

Anne Hathaway is planning 17 costume changes according to one of the Oscar commercials, and I hope that each dress is more stunning and excessive than the next.
The Obama campaign has justified any action on the grounds that it has a right to "hold the eventual Republican nominee accountable," but this is a dodge. Politics is rough, but a president has obligations that transcend those of a candidate. He swore an oath to protect and defend a Constitution that gives every American the right to partake in democracy, free of fear of government intimidation or disfavored treatment.

But (and it's a very important but) support for the death penalty, in Connecticut and elsewhere, is not as robust as it looks. When Quinnipiac asked a different question  "Which punishment do you prefer for people convicted of murder, the death penalty or life in prison with no chance of parole?"  only 46 percent favored the death penalty. An equal number chose life without parole. Death penalty opponents have an opening they haven't had for some time.
"The criminal-justice process many times can victimize a victim all over again," Morris County Prosecutor Robert Bianchi told the crowd. He noted that prosecutors' offices used to have very little contact with a victim's family, in terms of informing them about the judicial steps in the process or preparing them about what to expect. The victim-witness units filled that void. "What a change has occurred from what it was 25 years ago."

But diners eat in at Nguyen's newer restaurant Huong Vy, with its bistro ambience, stylized tropical décor and expanded offering of entrees. It's thrilling (and rare) to see banh khoai on any menu. The crispy, airy shells of pounded rice, which look a little like fried taco shells, require substantial skill to make. Filled with shrimp, pork and vegetables, they're delicious as is or wrapped in lettuce and herbs and dipped in the accompanying sweet-salty-fruity sauce. Banh it ram, another tour de force, combines chewy balls of warm shrimp-and-pork-filled mochi, each perched on a puffy silver-dollar-size, deep-fried rice cakelet. Every bite merges soft, springy and briny sensations — a textural ta-da!

Parents are remarkably bad at detecting their children's lies. In experimental studies of preschoolers, parents were able to detect accurately when their children were lying only 53% of the time—a little better than chance, according to a 2010 study led by Dr. Talwar. That falls to 33% by the time their kids are 6 to 8 years old. And parents of 9- to 11-year-olds have only about a 1 in 4 chance of knowing when their kids are lying.

Haseley was Strickland's campaign director in 2006 and director of the transition team, so the move is hardly surprising. But it's hardly a move, in the physical sense.

Signs of movement toward renewed cooperation between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas have Israeli officials on edge. Israel considers Hamas a terrorist organization committed to its destruction and has shunned negotiations. In the wake of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' efforts last fall to sidestep negotiations with Israel and seek United Nations recognition of a Palestinian state, it is easy to see this as another ominous sign for the prospects for peace. But there is another possibility at work. If Mr. Abbas can capitalize on the regional developments in political Islam sparked by the Arab Spring and exert a moderating influence on Hamas' extremism, he could do much more to realize his goals than he ever could have achieved through his end-run to the UN.

But you're right, we think there's a better way: Take DHA omega-3 supplements made from algae, not fish oil -- it's where fish get their omega-3s. With algae-based DHA, you avoid toxins like PCBs, found in some fish oil capsules. Also, omega-3s work together, but DHA is responsible for most of the heart-healthy benefits of fish oil, and gets transformed into EPA if you are short of EPA.

If employees are late to this meeting, often called a "daily scrum," they sometimes must sing a song like "I'm a Little Teapot," do a lap around the office building or pay a small fine, says Mike Cohn, president of Mountain Goat Software, Lafayette, Colo., an Agile consultant and trainer.

Jackson objected to a law he said gave "artificial distinctions ... to make the rich richer and the potent more powerful."
"Season of the Witch" is made up of three parts: Enchantment, Terror and Deliverance. Part One is the most fun, with its chapters on how Chronicle Executive Editor Scott Newhall turned a once-drab newspaper into "The Daily Circus" of the 1950s and 1960s; on "The Free City" of the proto-hippie movement the Diggers; and Talbot's account of early drag queens and the outrageous, LSD-fueled gender-bending chorus line that was the Cockettes.

However, Marion County Sheriff John Layton, a Democrat, has portrayed his troubles as more intractable, particularly spiraling inmate and arrestee medical costs.
Experts seem to agree that there are six elite players at the top of this draft. The No. 6 slot might lose some value to the Rams if cornerback Morris Claiborne or running back Trent Richardson fell to that spot after Blackmon and Matt Kalil. The Rams already have veterans in the lead RB and CB roles, so that might prompt the front office to trade down out of the pick for additional assets. Or the Rams could move up IF the football staff falls in love with Blackmon. How the staff assesses these high-end prospects during the weeks ahead should help Jeff Fisher and Les Snead chart their course.
After three months, the couple moved in together. In June, Quintero popped the question. The couple bought wedding bands and booked a pastor. She found a simple but elegant V-neck dress, and they set the date for Sept. 23, Quintero’s birthday.

"It's kind of our evolution. We have local hero Ray Jr., Bone Thugs, David Banner and The Kickdrums on the mixtape, and it's a sound that's very club based, which is different from what we've done before. When we started, we were more neo-jazz and hip-hop."

After wandering through the Plaza Machado, sneaking looks into private courtyards, I peaked into the recently restored Teatro de Angela Peralta (you may know it as the Opera House), where Handel's "Messiah" was playing. In the ballet studio next door, 21 teenage girls and one boy in toe shoes were at the bar, practicing their routines. As the pianist banged out a tune, the maestro herself — stern and imposing — went from one to the next, raising a leg higher there and arching an arm back here. The scene spoke of a tranquil lifestyle. But it didn't mean I had forgotten to stay alert.

Third, and best, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson joins the cast as a ruthless federal manhunter whose task force is assigned to nab Dom and Brian at any cost. Imagine if Tommy Lee Jones' team from "The Fugitive" spent three hours a day pumping iron and 25 hours a day glistening, and you're starting to get the idea. Between this and last year's overlooked "Faster," it's great to see The Rock re-embracing the action genre, and when his clobbering match with Diesel finally happens, it's as outlandishly room-wrecking as I'd hoped.

I hope your parents are supportive. They (and you) should call a meeting immediately with the administration of your school to insist that this name-calling must end. If your parents aren't helpful, seek out a sympathetic teacher or counselor. The teacher needs to apologize for her behavior and change her ways. Otherwise she should not be teaching.

There are two main Whitney routes: Up and Down, the standard 22-mile roundtrip, going in and out the same steep trail, which is what most people do. Or you can do what we did, and what the big kids do, which is to go Up and Over, starting at a distant trailhead, hiking a giant horseshoe-shaped route, and coming down the main trail. We would carry our packs and our body weight up a total of 8,320 feet, according to my cumulating altimeter watch.

Yes, Social Security is an intergenerational compact. The payroll taxes of today's working-age children go toward benefits for their elderly parents who have retired after a lifetime of work. It is a way of spreading costs, so individual families aren't burdened with the costs of taking care of elderly parents who have lived beyond their savings. In turn, their children will do the same for them when they become too old to work.

We believe the state needs to develop a strategy for adequately funding mental health services for people incarcerated in jail, whether directly to the sheriffs' departments, directly to the Community Mental Health organizations, or through resolving the insurance benefit issues.

DITA VON TEESE: A lot of people say they can't believe I started my career in Orange County, but I remind them that another stylish girl named Gwen Stefani came out of Orange County. A lot of cool things came out of the O.C. It makes sense that I came out this way.
That was the last recollection I have of her, and when she was no longer a member of our class, I don't recall anyone giving it a second thought.

At least up until now, Best Buy has resisted some of the Black Friday creep, allowing its fans to sleep in a bit more by opening its doors at 5 a.m. last year.

Rick Santorum, the defeated former senator from Pennsylvania, was given no chance when he announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination.

I know Barner appeared to indicate he was staying, but I don't think we will know for sure until the declaration deadline is behind us. Running backs take a beating.

Avocado's texture is also easily thinned with liquids to make creamy beverages. A vegan Avocado Frappé Smoothie uses soymilk and brown sugar, while the nonvegan alternative with milk and sweetened condensed milk emulates more closely the sweetened avocado drinks that are popular in Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands. And in the true spirit of Cinco de Mayo, consider toasting General Seguín's victory with an Avocado Margarita.

Comedy of manners turns into full-blown farce at the hands of Yasmina Reza in "God of Carnage." That's a bit disappointing after savoring the French playwright's lighter and more piercing touch in plays like "Art" and "The Unexpected Man." But it can be very funny in the no-holds-barred version now at San Jose Repertory Theatre.

While working as a nutrition educator at Community Mercantile in Lawrence, Kass encountered a steady stream of customers with food sensitivities. There are plenty of grains that can stand in for wheat, but Kass was unfamiliar with many of them. Curious, she began experimenting.

She grinds flax seeds to a powder then adds water to create an egg substitute.

When it became clear that the Baltimore Grand Prix was in financial ruin and wouldn't be able to pay the city millions it owed in taxes and expense reimbursement — not to mention millions more it owed to the state and to assorted vendors — former Baltimore Racing Development CEO Jay Davidson took to The Sun's op-ed page to pin the blame on the lack of subsidies from the city.

The Greater Phoenix Convention and Visitors Bureau on Friday issued a statement saying, "The lifting of the boycott is clearly a step in the right direction.

Some experts cautioned that the jury is out about whether the new unity government will set Netanyahu on a more moderate course, even though President Obama and other global leaders might pressure him to move in that direction.

“The board has never recommended any solutions to deal with the number of traffic accidents. It is a legitimate issue and I fully agree that we need to cut down on these collisions, but the first reaction is to kill the deer.

Fisherman's Wharf isn't as old, but has become one of the top tourist destinations in the United States. It was in 1916 that Castagnola's opened, preceded by a street-side stand selling crab and crab cocktails. The Alioto family, an important name in local politics, established their crab stand in 1925, and Sabella & LaTorre started in 1927. All these restaurants thrive today, giving a unique character to the waterfront. Yet, as with Chinatown, many of the restaurants that line the water are caught in a time warp and haven't kept up with the restaurants in other parts of the city.

A: I was just trying to hit every shot as best as I could. I just hit nine really bad shots on that one hole (the par-5 No. 15), so I think it is just keeping a level head about you and not letting what happened in the past influence what you are going to do in the future. It was definitely possible that I could have gone the other way and made a couple more doubles and a couple more bogeys and had a really bad final round, but staying in the right frame of mind really helped me.

HYDRAULICS: Hydraulics and the sensation of being elevated and descending can be experienced in elevators, hospital beds and even on some wheel chairs. Since the latter two may be difficult to come by ask your friends if they know someone who lives in pet-friendly building with an elevator. Take the puppy into the elevator, offer it a treat, go up one floor and treat the whole way. Go back down treat the whole way. Repeat this process so that your puppy becomes desensitized to the hydraulic motion of the elevator. When that is achieved withhold treats until you reach the first floor. When you arrive, treat. Descend and treat when you arrive. You may also ask your vet if you can borrow one of his hydraulic tables for just this purpose. When using a hydraulic table make sure it is elevated only a few inches during each repetition. In an elevator the animal can't see objects becoming smaller as the table is lifted above them. He can on a hydraulic table, so this must be taken slowly to achieve the best results.

Occupy Wall Street worked - kind of, for a while - because its message, that American society is stacked against the working man and the rich rig the system to benefit themselves, resonated in reality. Protests against NATO won't work because there's no reality to echo against. We could list our problems for a week and never get to NATO. In fact, I would wager that the general impression of NATO is positive: It's one of the few institutions that actually functions. The Soviet Union collapsed - a good thing, though maybe not to those who clung to the dream - and the powerful should try to prevent innocents from being slaughtered. That it isn't done perfectly is not an argument against trying.

But Spielberg is a realist. The shark — or the alien or horse — has to be good, too. He cast his war horse for the film first. Then he spent months finding the right young man to play Albert, the boy whose father sells his horse to the British Army and who follows the horse across the English Channel and onto the battlefields of World War I.

They were persuasive. I decided that my job was done at OLPC: I made the laptop they said couldn't be made and, if we could get this technology into other devices, I could solve the next big problems.

"While it is unfortunate that the residents of the fourth legislative district will not have full representation in the Assembly until the Supreme Court ultimately decides the case, we believe that the final outcome will be that the voters will have their choice honored and Ms Mosquera will be the Assemblywoman, Tambussi said.

Whedon writes with a perfect ear for each character's personality. What could have been a Babel of competing voices becomes almost musical counterpoint. There's Captain America's old-school idealism, Thor's flowery Elizabethan diction, and secret agent Black Widow's Bourne-like remorse for her ruthless past. Tony Stark's arch sarcasm, which wore thin in the previous Iron Man movie, is used here in effective small doses. When the robo-warrior grabs super-archer Hawkeye by the collar and warns "Clench up, Legolas" before jetting them both sky-high, the gag cracks like a bullwhip.

Nothing wrong with dreaming. Heck, three NFL teams drafted four rookie starters just last year. Of course, those teams had a collective 40 picks to pull off the feat. The Bears have six selections, and they are choosing late in rounds as punishment for an 11-5 season that included hosting - and losing - the NFC Championship Game against the Green Bay Packers. The Bears fielded one rookie starter in that game, right tackle J'Marcus Webb, a seventh-round pick.

Competitive moments in GOP primaries of years past have been fleeting things.

While Stanford doesn't make a profit, it needs to break even.

• As bad as Stoudemire must feel right now, the Daily News' Mike Lupica feels the real blame should land elsewhere: "What we do know is that the Knicks were completely and officially pathetic before Stoudemire got to town. Then they weren’t. For 50 or so games, the Knicks were fun to watch again. This was way before Melo or Linsanity, any of that. This was when it was Amar’e and the Italian kid, Gallinari, and Raymond Felton and Wilson Chandler and Landry Fields... Was this a world-beating future NBA champion? Nope. But they seemed to be an ascendant team and, really, who knows what happens if they wait on Anthony, or maybe even don’t sign him at all, who knows what happens if they don’t trade half the team for Anthony when they do and THEN Deron Williams becomes available?"

Six years ago, one week before Christmas, I bundled my two children on a plane and flew away from our beloved home in California. I don't think there was a single moment during that flight when at least one of us was not in tears. We were leaving behind people and places we loved, and we felt bereft, and unprepared for what lay ahead. My older daughter was seven at the time and was not a big fan of shoes; I hadn't wanted to fight with her on such an already-difficult day, and thus we arrived on a blustery, sleety, below-freezing night with her little feet shod only in bright red flip-flops. It did not seem an auspicious start.

Most of the teens I spoke with who have jobs know they are fortunate. Many of their peers want part-time or hourly work but are being turned away. The increase in minimum wage and higher unemployment among adults has caused experienced workers to claim entry-level positions, leaving fewer jobs open for teens. Indeed, about 4.2 million 16- to 19-year-olds hold jobs today, compared with 5.8 million five years ago. The majority of those jobs remain part-time positions.

That challenge, coming on the back of Mr. Romney's tax release, was all the more reason for him to change the narrative by seizing on a big idea like comprehensive tax reform. He could have underlined how the tax code that Mr. Obama wants to further contort only undermines growth and leaves average Americans paying a higher effective rate than does Mr. Romney. Instead, he complained that Mr. Gingrich's tax simplification plan would let off rich guys.
Weight gain causes fatty acids to overflow into muscles and the liver, rather than stay in fat cells and cholesterol molecules where they are normally stowed, Plutzky says.

But the script – peppered with Poe references (some of which have to be explained), is fun, especially for Poe fans, who might be tempted to cast a jaundiced eye on this endeavor. Still, if the movies can give us H.G. Wells as a real time traveler (“Time After Time”), why not a Poe who is a lover, a man of action, an amateur sleuth who sacrifices all for art and love?

Tomorrow night's show won't address that deficiency all at once, but it is a step in the right direction. Several locals have coaxed Mike Dillon — better known as Mike D — to a club right across the street from the state capitol building. Dillon, who comes to New Jersey from New Orleans, is probably the world's foremost punk-rock vibraphonist — and if that sounds like something of a contradiction to you, chances are, you haven't caught him in action. The musician plays jazz with the intensity of a buzzsaw rhythm guitarist, and invests his grooves with the freewheeling spirit of a funk master. Dillon has played with Les Claypool and Ani DiFranco; his 2009 release, "Rock Star Bench Press," revealed a fiery and occasionally confrontational political conscience, too. This show is a benefit: proceeds from the evening go to making the venue a permanent pop fixture in the Garden State's capital. Now, there's a cause worth believing in. Appearing tomorrow night at the Contemporary Club, 176 W. State St., Trenton, 7 p.m.; $10; call (609) 392-9727.

The web browser is resoundingly mediocre. Explorer is a rare case where I wished for a little more onscreen guidance from Windows Phone (the Maps app is another). Managing multiple webpages was trickier than it should have been. Also, Explorer often made rendering mistakes. These errors weren't frequent, and they were never the sort that made a page hard to read. Also, dammit: it's a web browser. Android and iOS both use the same web rendering engine. It's possible that I'm just looking at a bit of CSS that had special case-exceptions for the peculiarities of those two browsers but not for Windows Phone Explorer.

Even the most buttoned-down of broadcast networks is pushing its business online: CBS research guru David Poltrack told an industry conference that "a viewer streaming our program online is now worth substantially more to us than a person watching that program in playback mode and skipping many of the commercials."
There are other mobile card-reading devices, but most are built as hard cases that wrap around the phone and have fixed readers at the bottom, making them more or less permanent additions to a phone. The Square can be removed easily, put back on, even shared. And it works. Even my beat-up debit card, which failed last month at a local restaurant, swiped through at Garden State with no problem.
Still, Bielory said, “The actual count is high so that allergy sufferers will be feeling it, especially (if) they are sensitive to oak or birch.” Those species have just started to pollinate, Bielory said.

The plateau around Lake Patzcuaro in Michoacan, best known for its Day of the Dead celebration, is the domain of the indigenous Purhepecha people. Pirekua, their gently rhythmical traditional music, originated with pre-Hispanic indigenous cultures, but as practiced today it is laced with African and European colonial influences. At least 30 regional variations have been found among roughly 100,000 Purhepecha people living in 165 villages. Performers may be men or women, performing as solos or in duets or trios. They might be accompanied by choral groups or orchestras with or without wind instruments. Pirekua is often sung in the P'urhépecha language and interpreted in Spanish, but sometimes it is presented as an instrumental, usually characterized by stringed instruments. Performers are famously creative in interpreting songs of past generations to relate to a wide range of historical, religious and political thought, always including love and courtship.
I made fun of Transformers for being a film with great visuals, but poor acting and dialogue. This movie has great acting, slightly better dialogue, and yet I still wasn’t that impressed.
Maraziti said the improvement projects involve upgrading the bio-solids facility that handles sludge, and repairing an interceptor sewer pipe built in the 1970s that runs 14 miles from Wharton to Parsippany. “Part of it has disintegrated,” he said.
So long as we permit the message to be "just a little bit more will be enough," we will be ruled by big government Democratic politicians in Maryland. Like Ronald Reagan said, "Government always finds a need for whatever money it gets."
Sgt. Sean Drenth met or exceeded expectations throughout his 12-year career, records show, aside from one breach of policy.

Soon after American Commercial Realty closed on the $19.3 million purchase of Mark Twain Mall from Greater Missouri Builders in May, Chief Operating Officer Rick Baer began thinking about renaming it. But he said he never contemplated dropping Missouri's most famous author from the marquee.
The cause of the fire is still under investigation and anyone with information is encouraged to contact the State Fire Marshal, 410-836-4844.
The film opens by introducing the rookie cop Rama (Iko Uwais), who recites his morning prayers on a prayer rug, undergoes a grueling physical workout, and then tenderly kisses his pregnant wife goodbye. He will be our avatar. The van carrying his team parks in front of the building and is met by a gray-haired man wearing a bulletproof vest over a bright sports shirt. He is the lieutenant who has set up the raid. Wearing clothes that make you stand out from all the others is a dimwitted move, but then again, how bright is Tama (Ray Sahetapy), the crime lord, by barricading himself on the TOP floor? Elementary strategy suggests he can be cornered there. He reminds me of my beloved movie cliche, The Climbing Killer.
Maybe Cooper never had to play such bad Michigan teams as Tressel does now, but, in that regard, you can't say enough about Rich Rodriguez, Carr's successor. He is a one-trick pony, running the spread offense before he had the personnel for it and chasing off talented players like quarterback Ryan Mallett (to Arkansas) and lineman Justin Boren (to, of all places, Ohio State). Rich Rod's team will go a bowl at last this year, albeit one low in significance and high in indifference.

TRENTON —The Burlington County Republican who turned down former Gov. Jon Corzine's nomination to become a state judge is getting a second chance.
Big Macs, fries and milkshakes will be part of McDonald's exclusively branded menu at the Olympics and the fast-food giant will soon be opening its largest franchise in the world, a two-story cathedral-like restaurant that seats 1,500 customers, at London's Olympic Park. McDonald's will be the only restauranteur allowed to sell brand-name food at the games and there will also be a separate McDonald's within the athletes' village - in addition to three others at the Olympic Park.

Dear Margo: I've been close to "Maggie" for 30 years, from the time we were young mothers in our 20s. We've always had a joke pledge that we would never do anything to our faces. I don't know what your position is, but we both thought it was unnecessary and phony. Well, lo and behold, Maggie, after some weeks away ("visiting a cousin"), returns looking, uh, quite refreshed. I mean, the wrinkles are gone, and so are the jowls. What would you suggest I say to open this discussion? — Longtime Friend

New Rams defensive coordinator Gregg Williams could be subject to disciplinary action, either in the form of a fine or a suspension, for his role in the New Orleans Saints' violations of the NFL's "bounty rule."
Russo was right. His show is freewheeling and offbeat — and a surprise hit. That program director isn't at the station anymore, but program director and radio veteran Leslie Fram has given the deejay the liberty to be as playful as he wants to be. Free to play whatever catches his ear, "Anything Anything" feels like a throwback to a bygone era of personality-driven radio playlists. Russo chases whims: On his March 6 show, he spun four songs in a row with the word "alligator" in their titles.
SLUH isn't as big as it's been in the recent past. Instead, it is going with a mostly guard rotation with Daniel Schmidt (6-5) playing in the post. What SLUH lacks in athleticism it more than makes up for in poise and wits. Down 11 points midway through the third quarter, it would have been easy to let Maplewood have its way with the rest of the game and run them out of the gym. Instead the Jr. Billikens caught their breath and went back to work. It was impressive to watch.

COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Ohio's presidential primary will likely be moved from March to May once GOP lawmakers roll out their final version of a wide-ranging election reform bill, possibly by the end of the week.
That triggered a lukewarm on-air reaction from ESPN draft guru Mel Kiper Jr., who believed the Patriots had greater needs at linebacker and may have been better suited taking any number of players to fortify their defense, from Oregon's Ed Dickson to Texas' Sergio Kindle to Penn State's Sean Lee.
From 1968 to 1974, Os Mutantes released a half-dozen albums before lineup changes, government pressure and excessive use of LSD led to the group's demise. But with DJs such as Gilles Peterson releasing compilations featuring Tropicalia artists, and mainstream cultural figures such as David Byrne, Beck and the Flaming Lips trumpeting Os Mutantes' significance and influence, the band and its style have made a comeback. McDonald's even used the Os Mutantes classic "A Minha Menina" in a recent ad.

Tickets to spring training games are less expensive than regular season games, ranging from a low of $6 to $40. The facilities are smaller than MLB parks, meaning spectators are close to the action. Some stadiums, such as Camelback Ranch in Glendale, where the White Sox and Dodgers play, have free parking.
Such obstacles never seem to faze Daigle and friends. They go about the act of artistic archeology like missionaries who won't be distracted. If this means preserving every original note and word (always in English), so be it.
The show was packed with filler -- a montage whose theme seemed to be "movies we liked years ago"; a compilation of actors talking about the first movies they saw; and a 5-minute performance by Cirque du Soleil (introduced by Kermit and Miss Piggy) that had only the remotest connection to the subject at hand.
The difference she made: Skowronek, her daughter and varsity cheerleader Natalie Skowronek, and about 10 other girls decided to sell the shirts. The issue caused a divide between the school and the community, and resonated throughout the country. The cheer booster club ended up disbanding. The girls collected more than $10,000 for breast cancer research, and are still selling the $15 shirts through saveyourbumps@yahoo.com.
Martina describes herself as an athlete and breast cancer survivor. And says after breast cancer she didn't see any reason to fear dancing. Tony says, "I'm not the bad boy or the bad boy's brother" and that he's ready to win the trophy. It's a Dovolani/Chmerkovskiy feud! Martina says that what scares her the most is the "high heels." Now, see, Martina can get away with saying she's not very feminine waaaaay more than a traditionally beautiful woman like Maria. I absolutely love the way the announcer says "Navratilova." Whoa, the back of Martina's dress is almost entirely sheer and she is still in tremendous shape. You can see her trying to remember the steps in her head, as they foxtrot to "Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby," but she looks great and her athletic background means she's not visibly panting in front of the judges. Carrie Ann compliments her beauty and wants her to work on her spins. Len wants more wow, less caution. Is that Chris Evert in the audience? I remember watching tennis as a kid when their rivalry was so huge. Martina has a sense of humor when Brooke compliments her on her appearance saying, "With all this hair, with all this makeup … If I don't look good now, it's over."
That's good news. The Oregonian's project most closely resembles (at the moment) the J-Lab project at the Seattle Times. That project has already resulted in some partners seeing traffic increases of up to 400%. A survey conducted by J-Lab and released today, finds that the Seattle Times project, now over a year old, has garnered significant public support. The report says that 8 out of 10 respondents appreciated the Times for helping them find local blogs and news sites.

There is much to be sorted out as the team enters the offseason. Players, coaches and management all have work to do to ensure the Kings aren't in this position again next season.
World Peace returned in the second half and provided more hustle plays. He set up Andrew Bynum and Matt Barnes on fast-break drives. He also converted on two baskets after grabbing steals. But those plays came too late, as the Lakers trailed 91-70 entering the fourth quarter.

On his meddlesome father: "One thing I talked with my dad about is my dad can be a bit negative at times, just because he wants the best for me and he's scared that I'm not going to do the right thing. He always looks at it from the point of I'm not doing enough, you can always do more. I talked to him about trying to be positive with me, keep me in a positive light and I think that's something that can help me because he is such a big influence on my game and my overall mentality. Positivity, stay positive, because I think if I stay positive and I'm having fun, like last year at the beginning of the season with St. Louis, I was having fun, just relaxing, playing the game, and I played great. If I can try to do that all year, stay positive, have a lot of positive vibe coming at me, it'll help my game."

Ending the guesswork. It's tiring work even for a young DIY-er to hold a level while positioning a picture frame for hanging. An array of new levels combine laser precision with suction cups that adhere the level to just about any wall or surface so you can use both hands for something besides holding the level in place. The laser changes colors to let you know when the device is level. Taking it a step further is Black & Decker's Linefinder orbital, which has a dial on the side to let you know the optimum speed for the cut you intend to make. And it comes with a marker you can use to draw on your piece -- but the mark shows up only under the blacklight that's included with the tool.

The footage showed Baggins lost in Gollum's cave. Andy Serkis' portrayal of the strange creature known for his "precious" obsession and speaking in the third person is just as disturbing as it was in the trilogy, with Baggins forced to appeal to Gollum's love of games to survive.
All the liaisons here are dangerous, and cinematographer Ivan Strasburg ("Bloody Sunday") keeps the lens trained on the faces, capturing the characters at their most vulnerable and their most venal. The filmmaker handles some members of this classy cast better than others — he's best with Elliot, less sure with his star. Her sadness overwhelms too many scenes, turning her lament into a whine.

Google and YouTube seem to think so as well or they wouldn't be trying to negotiate contracts with major copyright owners.

It is a case that has become remarkably high-profile — including with the addition of Webb — and one that seems to have a lot of smoke on its surface. The police investigation was sluggish, files went missing, even a mysterious notation surfaced on the back of one police report that appears to reference Vanecko's relationship to the mayor. In appointing a special prosecutor, Toomin wrote that the public's perception of impropriety matters most. By making Webb the special prosecutor, Toomin made clear that he considers the matter grave.

A car wreck is not just one collision; it's three. First, you have the vehicle collision - when your car, truck, SUV, dune buggy or whatever hits something. Then comes the body collision, when your body hits the inside of the vehicle. Then you have the organ collision, when your organs slam against the inside of your body. Not pretty.

Marreese Speights (8.9 ppg, 6.3 rpg) has stayed in the Grizzlies starting lineup even with Zach Randolph coming back from a knee injury because of what he brings to the table.

The Five-Year Engagement gets draggy here and there, and there's a tendency to veer into the land of cute (the flashbacks to Violet and Tom's costume-party first encounter are replayed, and replayed again). But the level of emotional honesty is refreshingly high, and the level of writing refreshingly sophisticated. Old doughnuts, new doughnuts, it's a good mix.
For years this wasn't a problem, but the recession then took a toll on demand for the four-star hotel's swanky rooms, which can cost $400 a night.
I can't imagine that this measure has been properly thought through; I and most of my friends and family (who I questioned) re-use the plastic bags as trash bags; so how does it make sense to ban plastic grocery bags, when people like myself will just have to go to the grocery store and buy "plastic trash bags"; the same amount of plastic bags will still end up in landfills. – Darlene Ashley, Encinitas

"Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol" star Paula Patton was pure sunshine in a strapless mermaid gown, and "Extra" host Maria Menounos wore a simply cut cap-sleeved gown covered neck to hem in Big Bird yellow sequins.

Auto makers have good reasons to go along with government efforts to mandate higher fuel economy. Europe and China are ahead of the U.S. in demanding advanced petroleum-saving technology. In Europe, for example, the European Union has set a target for average carbon dioxide emissions of 95 grams per kilometer by 2020—the equivalent of about 65 miles per gallon. That means a lot of highly efficient diesel subcompacts.

When Claiborne came out of high school, the schools that recruited him knew he had a learning disability. I don’t know much about his disability other than it has to do with reading. Everyone I have talked to tells me that Claiborne has great character and is a great kid. He knows and understands his disability and uses all the resources that LSU has available to control it and to help him get by in the classroom. When it comes to football he puts in extra time to learn and understand his assignments and it is not a problem. Will he need reps? Probably, but no more than the usual rookie would need. In saying that, Claiborne’s test score was NOT a true indicator of his intelligence. He can and does learn.

You can also get the same dough stuffed with pleasantly bland shredded daikon or charmingly sweet curried pork, or just sweetened and hollow.

Barry Bonds always will be a Hall of Fame candidate. He surely is one of the 10 best players of his generation and probably several others. But will he be a Hall of Famer? That is a question I don't have to worry about answering for another three years or so, until he would become eligible. The biggest question of all, though, may be how would the Hall of Famers receive Bonds if he were elected?. My guess is not very well. American is a forgiving nation but Bonds, and for that matter, Roger Clemens, have shown very little if any contrition for their actions or suspected actions. That creates the sense that they feel they are bigger than the game. And they're not.
Now it is up to Rhoades to continue to build. This coaching hire is vital to the continued success of the program.
Her observation of how a very ordinary argument was escalated and criminalized is also very illuminating. The city has no compelling evidence of wrongdoing, so it is scrambling to transform hearsay into evidence.

Wallace insisted he wasn't emotional about facing the Lakers at the Palace one final time Tuesday night. It was against Bryant that Wallace planted his basketball legacy eight years ago as the Pistons dismissed the divided Lakers in five games in the NBA Finals.
Social Security expenditures exceeded the program's non-interest income in 2010 for the first time since 1983, and were projected to do so again in 2011. But reserves in the system's trust fund are projected to continue to grow through 2022, covering any annual cash deficits. After 2022, trust fund assets would be sufficient to cover full benefits until the reserves are exhausted in 2036, according to annual reports. Thereafter, tax income would be sufficient to pay only about three-quarters of scheduled benefits through 2085.
In fact, raising the debt ceiling has nothing to do with long-term future spending. The debt ceiling is about paying for spending already approved by previous Congresses and presidents.

Fong said he doesn't anticipate "a spike" in local Asian Americans playing basketball because of Lin. Sacramento has for decades had high participation in Asian American youth and church leagues, as well as high school freshman and junior varsity teams.
Asked about Gabriel’s penalty, Portland general manager and head coach Mike Johnston said: “I think Gabes when he went back for the puck was thinking Cheveldave was going to move left, so Gabes went right and he ran over him. You probably have to call it, I would think. It wasn’t something intentional, but he thought the goaltender was going to step out of the way, so he anticipated which way, because he had a lot of speed, and he went the wrong way.”
Lincoln took responsibility in August 1862 for failures that had been attributed to General George McClellan—eventually sacked for incompetence—and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. Lincoln told a crowd that McClellan was not at fault for seeking more than Stanton could give, and "I stand here, as justice requires me to do, to take upon myself what has been charged upon the Secretary of War."

As he stood sweating in the hot San Diego sun with a large adidas duffle bag slung over his shoulder, Vest said there was only one thing he really wanted now. "A shower."
The Vikings signed veteran quarterback Donovan McNabb last season. McNabb will no doubt go into the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame someday, but he was benched first by the Washington Redskins in 2010, then the Vikings last year. The labor lockout that wiped out the Vikings' offseason minicamp and OTA programs last year ruined McNabb's chances with his new team before he got started.
A: Hey, Rich: I don't see the Browns trading for Forte. They'd have to pay him at least his franchise salary of $7.7 million and trade valuable picks for him. Better to draft a promising prospect such as a David Wilson from Virginia Tech.

Training primarily against men and competing at 57 kilos (125.7 pounds), the native of Oak Harbor, Wash., went undefeated at the college level. Malloy graduated -- making the dean's list along the way -- in December and now works out with the team as an assistant coach.

Done at 12:31: Half hour. Remarkably tight and coherent speech (it's not his usual way). But looking at the substance, much of this isn't soup yet. On pensions, Medicaid reform and tax loopholes -- the three big savings areas he's counting on, and which he's identified as urgent -- there were no numbers at all, but rather a vow to form working groups to come up with numbers.

But an opinion that in theory is eminently just threatens to result in a manifest injustice in Baltimore. At first blush, the high court's ruling appears to bolster the case of former Baltimore Catholic school teacher John J. Merzbacher, who was sentenced to four life terms on six counts of child rape and sexual abuse and faced 100 other charges for similar crimes. He destroyed dozens of lives, and despite his age (70) and years in prison, his victims still fear for themselves, their children and for the community. But a federal judge agreed last year with his contention that he was never informed of a plea offer, and that echoes the circumstances of one of the cases the Supreme Court addressed this week. For what he has done, Mr. Merzbacher deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison. Fortunately, the court ruling leaves open several avenues for Maryland officials to make sure he does.

Although Oregon's dry side was bypassed by the oil and gas boom that roiled the West in recent years, it's clear that won't be the case with wind. That could change the view from atop Steens Mountain or on Interstate 84 while driving toward Boise.

On the edge of town a mule tethered to a hitching post tried to lick my camera, and I passed a weathered tortoise out for a leisurely stroll. Randsburgians love their tortoises; these desert tanks are treated as valued pets and claim protected status.

We wouldn't care about them collectively if we didn't know them individually, and it helps to have four Oscar nominees in this bunch.

When she was in high school, there were no girls sports on the state high school level. We went to court against the Michigan High School Athletic Association in Detroit and Judge Damon Keith ruled that they could compete on boys teams.

Currency chaos and defaults by governments and companies would weaken European banks and also cause them to stop lending to one another. Because banks are connected globally, a credit freeze in Europe would spread. As it did in 2008, a credit freeze would cause stock markets to sell off worldwide, and another deep recession would probably follow.

I love baseball and the experiences that come with working with a Major League baseball team, such as traveling to other cities and countries, building relationships with local and national writers, producers, reporters and photographers, and working with a number of players and coaches. I would have to say that my favorite part of my position is using the resources to get out into the community and help make a difference. When I take a player to visit a school or children's hospital or to host a clinic or meet and greet - it's all about that look in a child's eye and knowing that you made a difference.

Outside of the lawsuits, Cedar Fair faces another possible roadblock: The acquisition needs approval from holders of at least two-thirds of the company's outstanding shares. Investors will be able to vote by mail or at a shareholder meeting that will happen 20 days after the company mails its proxy statement, which contains information on the merger, to shareholders. When that happens depends on how quickly the report is approved by the SEC, said Cedar Fair spokeswoman Stacy Frole.Getting the required votes might not be a breeze, since the company has few large, institutional shareholders, Thomison said. About 75 percent are small-time individual investors who could make their decision based more on emotions than number-crunching.

At one time, he only had second-hand knowledge of this. His own dad — the first Henry, and the grandfather of Giants fullback Henry Hynoski Jr. — was a poignant example: A star linebacker during the Depression, he was offered a scholarship to play at Fordham during the Lombardi years. But his mother, a widow just off the boat from Poland, incapable of grasping what it all meant, had other plans: Her son was going to work to help support the family, and the only place to do that was in the mines.

WELFARE CHECK, PEARL ROAD: At 11:55 a.m. June 5, police received a call regarding a possibly disoriented woman in a church parking lot. According to complainants, the woman took 25 minutes to park her vehicle and appeared to be wearing a nightgown as she wandered around the parking lot during a Mass. Police spoke with a friend of the woman’s, who stated that is simply how she dresses. She reported she was wandering around the parking lot because she hadn’t been to the church for a few years, and didn’t know where the entrance was. Police noted, “Other than appearing ornery, she appears to be OK.”
But true to his namesake — the legendary New York City rapper Rakim — Rocky is clear in his goals to define a generation of that city's rap. And part of that is to leave much of the genre's cultural baggage behind. Rocky — who is straight — has been outspoken in his criticism of homophobia in hip-hop, and his braggadocio has an Oscar Wilde-ish touch (he calls himself "pretty" in lyrics).
Hillestad tried to get a refund. He called Barclay Bank, which operated the ATM and he visited his bank in Nebraska. But the banks did nothing to help.

We should hear from Mr. Romney on a matter of this kind. And in full and bold detail, what the voice of America will be in a Romney presidency—what it will stand for in regard to Syria, Iran, North Korea and Afghanistan.

From my visit 15 years earlier, I remembered that Delicate Arch wasn't easy to get to. I was surprised when my wife, Ashley, read from our guidebook that the hike would take only 15 minutes. Ten minutes into it, we were at the bottom of a steep sandstone hill. Twenty minutes later and only halfway up, our breathing was labored, and we were burning up. Looking ahead at the rest of the hill and the one beyond, we knew this couldn't be the hike Ashley had read about.

Or does it? After the first episode of “Luck” aired last week, message boards were full of complaints about the sound quality. It was hard to hear what the actors were saying, particularly Nolte and John Ortiz, who played Peruvian trainer Turo Escalante. Kevin Dunn, whose character is in a wheelchair and uses an oxygen tank, spoke into the mask at one point. When the dialogue was audible, it was hard to decipher. Many of the characters spoke cryptically and used a racetrack/gambler patois unfamiliar to the uninitiated. HBO anticipated that problem and put a glossary on its website, defining “pick six” and “bug boy” for those who’ve never been to Santa Anita, much less Portland Meadows.

There is a certain reliable pattern to each Maryland General Assembly session: The House and Senate will be at odds, 90 days worth of legislating will be condensed to about three weeks, and most bills of substance will be deferred or delayed.

I guess we will have to wait for the state to impose a stringent tax cap levy of 2.5 or 2.9 % next year and take this out of the hands of the local elected officials. Don’t bet on it though because there is bound to be a loophole and the local council majority (if they have a mayor on their side) will drive through loopholes on the way to your bank account. They won’t pull out copies of the last three adopted budgets and see that actual expenses were less than the budgeted expenditures (i.e. appropriated revenues). How can the council majority led by Mr. Bruno effectively govern through financial issues for our town if they can’t or won’t read the last three years annual financial statements to learn how the surplus is calculated?

I just found something that is beautiful and much more rich and powerful and somehow more original. I found many many new spaces in sound."

In the long run, he's financially secure to put it mildly, and rather than gimp around for another year, he made the ultimate team move and will be thankful for his decision as he gets older and is be able to take walks with his kids.

In fact, less than 2 percent of black-owned businesses in the state have more than five employees, the data shows. One in 10,000 have more than 500 employees. Part of the reason for this phenomenon is that most new black-owned firms are "nonemployer firms," which means they consist of only one person. Roughly nine in 10 black-owned firms fit this description, both in New Jersey and the rest of the nation. This trend is not new among African-Americans, but such firms multiplied at a much faster pace in the Garden State, which saw a 72 percent jump during the five-year window, compared to 13 percent for the nation, the data shows.

Let me give you an example of a case in which I think the IRS really blew it. We reported a Baptist church in northern Arkansas back in 2004 where the pastor has held a service on Independence Day. Part of the church's service even included registering voters registration (no problem with that). However, the pastor gave a sermon while flanked by two large screens. As he would start talking about an issue, photographs of George W. Bush or Sen. John Kerry would be flashed on the screen. When he said "one candidate" is fighting terrorists, a very nice official White House photo of Bush was shown; he'd then note in a mocking tone that "the other candidate believes we are not at war at all but in a lawsuit." An unflattering picture of Kerry in a crowd was shown. It went on like this for several issues. Bush was praised and Kerry was belittled.

But the reporting also shows Cerf can be thin-skinned, quick-tempered and, at times, less than forthcoming, even when the answers to questions could hardly be seen as damaging. Late last month, when The Star-Ledger found that Cerf had formed a consulting company that received a $500,000 contract, paid for by private donations, to perform an assessment of the Newark schools, the acting commissioner said he severed his relationship with the firm "literally right after its formation."

His father was a brooder who spent more time at the pub than his job as a welder; when he got home, he spoke with his fists.

And the 2006 Robert Mondavi Reserve Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon lists an alcohol of 15.5 percent, essentially the same as its tested result of 15.46. That seems painfully high for a wine that once landed in the mid-13s, but the number is accurate.

What most excites him at the moment, however, and will be his focus through the year or so it takes for the center's previously planned exhibitions to cycle through, is the development of a social practice residency program.

Hey, Hoynsie: Last week a man claiming to be Kevin Kouzmanoff's friend said he didn't sign with the Indians because they wouldn't offer him incentives. If he's right, why would the Indians not offer incentives? If he doesn't make them, it doesn't cost any money. If he does, I would assume they would be worth paying for. -- Tom Goodsite, Kirksville, Mo.

McCallin: Unfortunately what you are seeing in Colorado is that because state funding has gone down most recently from $706 million to a little under $500 million for state institutions, there's been a switch and what happens is that when state funding goes down, some of the cost of public education is going on to the student. About five years ago approximately 60-70 percent for the funding of higher education was coming from the state. Today that is flipped: 60-70 percent is coming from the student.
Doing so would help assure investors, companies and consumers that rates won't rise before a specific time. This might help lower long-term yields further — in effect providing a kind of stimulus.

Casino gambling was promoted in 1992 for the historic mining towns of Black Hawk, Central City and Cripple Creek, with proceeds promised to historic preservation there and across the state. Since 1993, State Historical Fund competitive grants totaling $247 million have gone to 3,379 projects statewide, giving many towns a new life. Half went to government entities — towns, counties and the state. The Governor's Mansion received $709,591 over the past 11 years. More than $30 million went to the state Capitol. The legislature has decreed that approximately $17 million from the SHF will go to repair the Capitol dome. The Colorado Historical Society, administrator of the Historical Fund, gets $5 million a year until 2045, totaling $185 million, for its gorgeous new History Colorado Center, which opens in April. You don't have to be a purist to think that's not truly historic preservation.

And this is the team that gets selected to play in the Sugar Bowl? This is where the system is flawed—and where the BCS administrators have no pretenses (sound familiar?) about the goal for every BCS bowl game outside the national title game: sell tickets, stimulate the economy, television ratings (in that order).
You'd almost have expected GCH to perform their No. 1 hit with Coach Adam Levine. Not tonight -- thumbing their noses at the bottom three members of each team was more important than connecting with stereo-hearted viewers at home.

In closing, this is a great time for a new quarterback to come to Indianapolis; the city has officially and indisputably become a football town. If you need evidence of that, consider this: Lucas Oil Stadium remained packed and energized last year as the Colts flirted with a winless season. Meanwhile, on Monday, as the NBA Pacers neared the end of a spectacular regular season and prepared for the playoffs, more than a dozen tickets to their game against the Detroit Pistons were selling for 99 cents or less on StubHub.com.
Comprehensive illustration of the connection between basketball and the city, however, requires peeping into the neighborhoods, feeling the rhythms of its playgrounds, hearing the shrieks of joy and the sobs of sorrow.

PG&E inspected Line 109 in 2009 using a method that was incapable of finding flawed seam welds. Yet two stretches of the line have such welds, according to PG&E records. PG&E officials have said they had been intentionally boosting the pressure on lines with such welds every five years or so since 2003, but stopped the practice after the San Bruno explosion. The company says it had been elevating the pressure because federal regulations - based on peak pressure levels - would otherwise kick in and limit its ability to meet peak demand.

Now before I begin getting hate letters from happy residents of Glen Park, I want to say my point is not that Bernal Heights is a better place to live than any other place. The point here is that neighborhood pride is extremely high -- whether deservedly so or not, we have drunk the same Kool-Aid. And this neighborhood boosterism has helped drive prices beyond the norm. As attorney Rebecca Eisenberg -- who recently moved from Bernal Heights to Noe Valley -- put it: "I love Bernal, but now that I am gone, I recognize what a cult it is!"

"Verrilli did an OK job but I'm sure many supporters of President Obama's healthcare reform were a little disappointed with his advocacy.

Kelly issued a statement through the university on Monday. He talked about the honor of wearing a Ducks jersey. He sounded disappointed. That kind of statement resonates with most players. But it hasn't yet hit the heart of Harris.
A: No. What's causing these injuries? Number one, it's unavoidable. These guys are bigger, stronger, faster than ever. They train all year. Number two, the equipment.

In the end, the restaurant comes off as amateurish and not ready for prime time. I'm not expecting three-star service. But is it too much to ask for a little common sense? Or thoughtfulness? I'd love to get a cease-and-desist order to prevent servers from continually checking in to ask if everything is "great." And the $30 corkage fee for a restaurant with such a weak wine list isn't the swiftest move either.

Yes, general manager Bill Torrey’s acquisition of Butch Goring that is the best deadline deal in NHL history freed up Trottier, but it took some time for a player even that special to come to terms with the playoffs and figure it all out. You never quite know when it’s going to click in.

But when the game beckoned for a hero, it was the rookie point guard who always answered the Bat Signal. Statistical gurus will use numbers to say Irving was among the league's most clutch players. Historians will use variables -- at least 18 points and five assists -- to say Irving's rookie season was on par with those of former No. 1 draft picks such as Oscar Robertson and Magic Johnson.

Umenyiora is scheduled to earn $3.975 million in base salary this upcoming season as part of the six-year extension he signed in December 2005. Umenyiora, who parted ways with his first agent a little more than a year after signing the contract, has said in the past he didn't understand it was in actuality a seven-year deal because he was already under contract for 2006.
that this year's field is wide open. Very difficult for me to handicap. There are 15 modern-day candidates and a maximum of five will make it. (The two Senior Committee nominees are voted on separately.) Back to the moderns: I think Aeneas Williams (Cardinals, Rams) has a shot but I don't have any real sense of how much support he'll have. There's a big push being made for former San Francisco 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. If selected, DeBartolo would go in as a contributor. I believe it's important to honor contributors -- non players -- but I don't like players and contributors being placed on the same ballot. I don't like having to choose between, say, Willie Roaf and a team owner or coach. It isn't fair to either side. I'd like to see our friends at the Pro Football Hall of Fame change this and put the contributors in a different category.

We understand Stanton's dilemma, but residents also are facing potential hefty state and federal tax increases, as well as inflation as seen every time one fills up a car's gas tank. Government should not cost more than the people's ability to pay. Increasing the city's tax burden actually could hurt Stanton, rather than help it.

Fortunately, a Texas judge recently wrote an opinion that provides pertinent clarity about the tension between judging and majoritarianism. The Texas Supreme Court, on which Don Willett sits, struck down a law for violating the Texas Constitution's prohibition of retroactive laws. The law immunized one company from a pending lawsuit by a man dying of asbestos exposure. The question was: Should the court blindly defer to the legislature's judgment that its police power -- its general authority to protect the public welfare -- trumped the constitutional ban on retroactive legislation?
In Britain, shares of Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland were down more than 2 percent. American banks were poised to open sharply lower later in the morning.
Still, talk to your doctor before starting this or any other complementary and alternative medicine, or CAM, treatment.

Hey, Michael: I don't consider a high second-round pick (Brees) "marginal or mid-round." The final eight playoff teams were led by the following quarterbacks: Brees, second round; Eli Manning, No. 1 overall; Aaron Rodgers, first round; Alex Smith, No. 1 overall; Joe Flacco, first round; Tim Tebow, first round; and Brady, sixth round. Houston had a mid-round rookie playing quarterback (T.J. Yates) because its top two QBs (Matt Schaub, second round; Matt Leinart, first round) were injured.

Torii Hunter homered for the fourth time in five games and Howie Kendrick also went deep against struggling Francisco Liriano, but Albert Pujols went 0 for 4 with a run-scoring groundout. The three-time NL MVP and two-time home run champ, who had 445 in his previous 11 seasons with St. Louis and hit a career-best 49 in 2006, has gone a career-worst 31 games and 125 at-bats since his last one on Sept. 22, 2011.

The best parts of the film, for me, came toward the end, when the lives of the four lovers become bittersweet and melancholy. They were so happy for a time. They were inseparable. Now it is all over. There's a flashback where they walk together down to the farm pond to wash off the flour. As they dry contentedly in the sun, Teri still has a little flour behind her ear. You can't do better than that.

Looking like a cross between a 1970s wood-paneled lodge and a bar lined with hundreds of bottles, the set somehow summons the Parisian cafés and Pamplona bullrings where the action takes place.

øThere's also a difference in style, since the Sith believers began as "middle-managers in the service of evil" and have found a way to channel ambition through the hierarchical structure, Miller says.

What about Little’s drops early in the season and what's your take on that? “I think the more you get comfortable with what you’re doing the actual skills that you need to perform become smoother, the game slows down and then again, it’s in college and in high school, with all due respect, there’s not a lot of defenses that get up in your face and challenge every move you make as a receiver. You see a lot of zone coverage, you see alto of free access. In pro football, they’re right up on you and I think that takes a little bit of getting use to for a receiver and that may be what you’re talking about. As you get more and more use to what we’re doing, where you’re supposed to be then I think catching the football then becomes a little bit more natural.”

A: The compact also has to be signed by the eight Great Lakes governors and then the U.S. Congress for it to become federal law. But there's also no guarantee that the U.S. legislature will approve the compact or even someday repeal it. That's a concern of Great Lakes legislators, especially if drought conditions were to worsen in the South and West -- the same area expected to gain congressional seats after the next U.S. Census. Still, legal experts say that the Congress has not stood in the way of hundreds of other interstate agreements in the last 50 years.

He respected and inspired every single person he came in contact with — players, coaches and support staff. He defied the odds by playing two decades in the NFL at a level and with a youthful spirit rarely seen but appreciated by everyone. Junior will always be remembered as an intense Hall of Fame player from the old school. He was a charismatic icon. At the same time, as a human being he was as caring, warm and lovable as they come. That’s what I will miss most of all. It was a privilege to have coached Junior Seau. My condolences to his family.”

Hey, Eric: I think Hasselbeck, who led Mike Holmgren's Seahawks to a Super Bowl, would be a fantastic mentor for Colt McCoy and a good bridge quarterback.

"It's big," Matt Brown said of the victory. "I mean, we haven't been playing the greatest baseball lately. We've played two solid innings and then we've played terrible the rest of the game. It was big to build our confidence up to go into tomorrow against Francis Howell."

Under the Ohio constitution, the attachment of the appropriation also means that the legislation becomes effective upon the expected signature of Republican Gov. John Kasich.

The decision to end "Desperate Housewives" was more difficult than most because over the years it had faltered creatively, then rebounded, only to falter again.

Maybe it is. Romantics have had a rough time of it on the pop playground over the past decade or so. There aren’t too many happy love songs near the top of the singles charts these days.

It started with his best shot of the week, a 5-wood into a stiff breeze on the par-3 eighth that caught a slope on the edge of the green and rolled 8 feet from the flag. That was the first of four straight birdies, and when his tee shot to the island-green 17th settled at the very back of the green, he was no longer in danger of going home early again.

It is fun just to listen to Brand talk (he’s like the Geico gekko, but with a substance-abuse problem). Rose Byrne has a ball as Snow’s not-so-posh, sort-of-Posh ex, and the movie gets the mad vacuousness of most celebrity journalism exactly right.
Prompted by the collapse of the stage rigging at the Indiana State Fair last August, an entertainment industry group is compiling voluntary national guidelines to improve safety at outdoor concerts.
8. Ronnell Lewis, Oklahoma, 6-2, 253. This early entrant probably won't fit in a 4-3 scheme. He needs to be in a 3-4. Lewis is a madman on the field and plays fast. He is quick, explosive and athletic. He does not make plays he should, however. He should be a fine special teams player.

The U.S. Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration says Sorrento Lactalis Inc.'s plans for managing potentially hazardous ammonia at the facility are inadequate.
øWhen you "match three," you also open spots on the board, since things morph. For example, three clumps of grass turn into one bush and two open spaces, and net you 25 points. The progression varies depending on the objects; but grasses combine to create bushes, bushes combine to create trees, trees combine to create huts and so on until the board is filled with manor houses, cathedrals, castles and more.

Today's 26-9 vote sends the measure back to the House.
Actually, both theories are correct -- and neither is. It's true that Wall Street took too many risks while government regulators watched passively; it's also true that the government's aggressive promotion of homeownership contributed to real estate speculation. But the fact that these theories are not mutually exclusive suggests that both were consequences of some larger cause. Just so. What ultimately explains the financial crisis and Great Recession is an old-fashioned boom and bust, of which the housing collapse was merely a part.

When asked how he responds to Americans who simply feel immigrants should return home if they’re here illegally, Kaper-Dale responded: "I would ask them if they are interested in sending people back to a place where they were persecuted?

The changes in individual oxytocin levels at Linda's ceremony could be mapped out like the solar system, with the bride as the sun. Between the first and second draws of blood, which were only an hour apart, Linda's own level shot up by 28%. For the other people tested, the increase in oxytocin was in direct proportion to the likely intensity of their emotional engagement in the event. The mother of the bride? Up 24%. The father of the groom? Up 19%. The groom himself? Up 13%…and on down the line.

Bruce Nauman's film and video pieces at Reed College's Cooley Gallery.

Despite this, Americans aren't notably healthier than people in other advanced countries, the study reports. Life expectancy in the United States (78.2 years) lags behind Japan's (83 years) and the OECD average (79.5 years). It roughly equals Chile's and the Czech Republic's, says Mark Pearson of the OECD. Americans don't have much to show for their system's enormous cost, even if the gaps in life expectancy partly reflect differences in lifestyle and diet.
Partnering with Teach for America will strengthen the hiring pool for many of our highest-need schools and subjects. Moreover, the organization will help us keep homegrown leaders who decide to join Teach for America here in our great city of Cleveland. Like in the other 43 communities where the organization works, Teach for America teachers will interview alongside other candidates for open positions and, if hired, become school district employees. In my experience, school districts want to partner with Teach for America because it creates a pipeline of talented teachers and leaders eager to work in the most challenging settings.

Quarterback Connor Cook, on his performance early in the spring game: "I felt focused, and a couple of my throws were getting away from me. The same thing happened in the second scrimmage we had. I was sailing a lot of balls early. Then as the scrimmage went on I started to feel more comfortable. Same thing happened today. My first couple throws got away from me. And then later on down the stretch, that one 2-minute drill (in the second quarter), that's where I kind of felt really comfortable and got in my groove."

So what took so long to get to this point? Well, the cracked main detected in November runs beneath three other waterlines and ducts filled with electric, phone and cable wires.

Impressions: I had hoped the Gentouch, with a faster processor than the Maylong tablet's, would be faster, but it's not. The touch screen may be the problem. It is slow to respond to touch, and the picture is never bright enough to properly fight off glare. Outside, it's almost unusable in the sun. This, like the Maylong tablet, feels like an unfinished product.
Kind of a slow week for wide releases at the theaters this week, except for the whole "Twilight" thing, of course.

Plus, "Inkubus," "The Women on the 6th Floor" and "Everyday Sunshine: The Story of Fishbone" are in limited release.

I suspect Jones wanted to write a feminist text, sort of Islam 101 for the post-"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" generation. I can't say whether, from a religious point of view, "The Jewel of Medina" is worth the anguish it's caused, but as literature, it's a misstep-ridden, pleasant-enough mediocrity.

Not that a robbery of two city restaurant-goers, one a senior citizen, should go unnoticed. If all robberies received the attention of the recent one in Roland Park, perhaps more criminals would be caught. Certainly, police presence would increase.
"We as parents are being the first generation whose children are getting less education than we got," says Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., a baby boomer who is nevertheless trying to get a student loan fix through the Senate.

I asked Charles Joly, mixologist extraordinaire at The Drawing Room, how such a good drink could end up so bad.
The biggest example of Steeler bias showed through when Florida scatback and special-teams ace Chris Rainey was taken at No. 159. Rainey has talent, but his name only was whispered in the weeks leading to the draft. Why? Because of health and character concerns -- especially character concerns. All of the drawbacks vanished when the Steelers came calling. Rainey instantly became a multi-talented weapon who automatically will "fall in line."
A witness Jones' lawyer, Craig Kadish, planned to call would have testified to the contrary that two black men jumped out of the Jeep, one of them armed, and when Jones saw them that's when he opened fire, according to Fili.

Champagne flutes highlight the bubbles but somewhat mute the wine's aromas, as they leave little room to swirl the glass or smell the wine. A white wineglass will reduce the fizz somewhat more quickly, but also heightens the aromas, as it allows you to better smell the wine. It can also help smooth out aggressively fizzy wine or enhance an aged one in which the layers of scents are more interesting than the bubbles. Some Champagne hounds prefer their bubbly to be less bubbly with certain dishes and will go so far as to serve it in bowl-like Burgundy glasses.

Protect your fruit trees from sunscald. It is not uncommon for midwinter's grip to ease long enough to allow sap to rise. When temperatures drop again to freezing, the tree cambium dies on the exposed west side, halting the passage of water and nutrients where the cambium has been damaged.

Peter had been unable to secure our first-choice camping spot -- a so-called chickee platform on stilts about 8 feet above the water in one of the inland creeks, about a 10-mile paddle from the ranger station. So we chose a beach site on an island encouragingly named Jewel Key, due west, dead into the wind.
"They were doing well," McKinney said. "It's tragic."

Another gem is DeFuniak Springs, a sleepy town of 5,000 just off Interstate 10. I took a one-mile walk around Lake DeFuniak, which is ringed by gracious Victorian homes that recall a time when labor and materials were cheap and no architectural detail was too elaborate. At Murray's Cafe, I ordered a fried green tomato sandwich with a side of fried okra and watched a CSX freight rumble through town.

Janis Stevens  fiery, confident, intense yet regal  stars as "Il Divina (the divine one)" in the extraordinary Capital Stage production that opened Friday. "Master Class" is not a one-woman show, but it might as well be. It's essentially a monologue interrupted by an interval and a series of cameos in which three aspiring singers take turns being alternately encouraged and discouraged by Callas. Even when she is not speaking, Stevens  as Callas  commands the attention. Director Jonathan Williams (whose pacing is precise throughout) and lighting designer Ron Madonia ensure that the diva, whether sitting or standing in the background, listening intently or lost in reverie, always is present. The eye can no more ignore her than the ear could ignore the voice of Callas.
Councilor Steve Hurst wondered whether Cosgrove had already provided notice that he would be leaving his current post in Silverton. "Because after this meeting, he might change his mind."

The worst part of rehab, he said, was regaining range of motion. Now, it's all about getting the leg back to full strength, a process that will continue through the spring and summer.
A wild-card growth opportunity is the possibility that Apple will release its own version of a television set. To be sure, the market for TVs is much smaller than the market for handsets. Households have more smartphones than they have TV sets, typically. And they replace their handsets at a more rapid rate. Yet Apple's top-notch product designers have an opportunity to streamline complicated on-screen menus and multiple remote controls. They can also cater to a small but growing segment of consumers that watch video content, but no longer subscribe to a cable package. Any TV sales would further entrench Apple inside households, possibly spurring sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs.

Delta Air Lines said last month that fewer flights to Japan and more expensive jet fuel will cut its 2011 profit by up to $400 million.
Smith: In the previous question, you said the arts is a real important part of the economy so how should we promote cultural tourism. I actually don't think the most important element of the arts in our economy is tourism. I think the most important element are things harder to calculate. It's not by accident that Wieden + Kennedy is in the Pearl District. There's a relatively famous lesson that explained the reason the United States won the space race was not because our engineers were better at math than engineers elsewhere. But because they had had art and shop and could access their whole brain to solve engineering problems. My hunch is, the most important element of our, of why the arts is crucial to the local economy is that it helps our workers, our people, solve problems and think about the world differently. Whether it's advertising or clean tech, we can compete in the global knowledge economy better.

"I think the things that are really wearing me out is the constant negative attacks and all it takes is to hang something out that's not true and then you have to respond and play defense constantly, and if you're playing defense constantly you can't play offense ... .

"It's not the same experience as reading about a Warhol in an art history book and going to the MoMA to see that exact Warhol," says Anna Sew Hoy, 35, a sculptor. "With PST, it's so much about seeing this stuff for the first time and not having read about or studied it in school first. The sense of discovery makes it feel very alive."

"Deprivation is for me," Philip Larkin once observed, "what daffodils were for Wordsworth." He was right, of course: Unhappiness, loss, disappointment, boredom and fear of death are the bread and butter of his verse. Larkin was the Eeyore of poets, the Debbie Downer of modern literature.

A. Manhattan. This is a writer's cliche, but it's my favorite place to go. New Yorkers are supposed to be rude, but nowhere in the world am I treated as well as when I'm in New York. New Yorkers really value writers. And it's one of those cities where as soon as you arrive, you can feel the molecules in the air changing. Its energy is completely its own. Last time I was there, I loved going to Ma Peche (http://www.momofuku.com/restaurants/ma-peche/) for dinner. Their noodles were insanely good, followed by a great, sugar-rich dessert at the Momofuku Milk Bar (http://www.momofuku.com/restaurants/milk-bar/). I'm also a big fan of Ippudo (http://www.ippudony.com/) in the East Village, which really does have the best ramen ever. When I'm on vacation, I like to walk a lot and be surrounded by city energy. Nothing beats Manhattan for sheer kinetic excitement -- the yellow cabs, the high rises, the fast-walking people.

​The former Seabra’s — one of Newark’s perennially popular restaurants — is now known as Rio Rodizio, and the name is a clue to the main attraction: the nonstop orgy of grilled meats known as rodizio. It’s all-you-can-eat meat, and it’s up to you to tell the waiter no mas. There’s an enormous salad in case you’re striving for nutritional balance. I’ll say this: If you don’t add rodizio to your NCAA tournament eating resume — whether here or at one of the Ironbound restaurants — you’ll be all the poorer.

The sun hadn’t yet set when the headlining band began playing at Maplewoodstock. It was bright and warm in Memorial Park, and the sky behind the outdoor stage was still a clear blue.

Yeah, the same story that’s been said the first couple of years. In the very beginning of the season, you started to see validation of the previous commentaries, that what we’ve been saying all along, that it’s part of the building process, that it takes time but they’re the foundation of it.

The Scene
Back when shakes cost 15 cents, Biff-Burgers dotted the Southeast. It stood for Best in Fast Food. They had drive-in service and walk-up windows, they had "roto-broiled" burgers topped with a closely guarded secret-sauce concoction. Now, it appears, there's only one Best left. Burger King may be responsible for the near-extinction of Biff-Burger, but St. Petersburg's George Musser stayed strong. His location still has the original Biff-Burger neon sign; the menu runs to barbecue sandwiches, burger baskets and soft serve; and on Friday nights the parking lot fills with hot rods and their devotees.

When you are stationed in the Pacific, you can't help but become so aware of the role of the Navy and the Coast Guard in World War II, with the attack of Pearl Harbor and all that followed and the significant contribution the Coast Guard made with the landings on the islands in the Pacific.

Pools on the road to Hana: As you can see from this list, I prefer the lush, rainy, green parts of Hawaii. The twisting, slow road to Hana on the eastern end of Maui passes by several pools fed by waterfalls. It’s an idyllic swimming hole for the adventurous able to withstand the cold. The pools come with their own dangers – slippery rocks (my wrist once took a whacking), waterborne illness and sudden flash floods that can turn a gentle waterfall into a thundering torrent. At least look, even if you don’t touch.

But Spoden noted that assessing a drought is largely subjective, with difficult-to-pinpoint origins and varying effects. Had the recent dry spell occurred during a growing season, he said, it "would have been mentioned among the great droughts in history."

Like many places these days, Avalon, long a seaside favorite of the well-to-do, isn't seeing a a lot of home sales, period. But those that have occurred have been high enough in value to push the median price up 321 percent since 2005, an Econsult Corp. analysis of transactions in 13 Shore zip codes in Atlantic and Cape May Counties from April 1, 2005, through June 30, 2011, shows.

It is not a student's fault if he or she is being shuttled from one parent or grandparent to another, has no time or place to do homework or is never encouraged to read.

"Gold Rush": More Oregon connections, as Todd Hoffman, of Sandy, and his crew keep on looking for that elusive yellow stuff. Tonight, according to the Discovery show description, "With the all-important washplant prepped, the Hoffman crew is finally ready to process dirt.

With the team mechanic forced to abandon them for medical help, the loader repair is left to a pair of local mechanics." At the rate things are going, it's not so much a gold rush as it is a gold stagger. (9 p.m., Discovery)

"It was just one night," Braun said. "There's no doubt this is one of the more challenging if not the most challenging place to hit home runs in the league. I think for fans, you want to see offense. Offense is exciting when teams are scoring runs. It's a lot of fun for the fans to watch. So I think if they did do that, it would make it more of a neutral ballpark.

It looks like a lot of work, but it looks like fun.' I don't think she has some misguided idea that it's going to be easy. She wants to do it the right way."

The reason for the peak of the heat this week? Credit what is called an "upper ridge." Think of it as high pressure in the upper part of the atmosphere. It will strengthen over us today, and that should result in drier conditions, keeping that cloud count down and also lowering the dew point slightly from the mugginess Wednesday. Dew point temperatures reflect the amount of moisture in the air, independent of the temperature. Those two elements are combined to come up with the relative humidity, or moisture in relation to the temperature. When the dew point gets above 60 degrees, people start noticing. Start moving into the mid 60s and they really notice. More than 70, and you're talking tropical The dew point in Indianapolis was 65 degrees or higher from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday. Workin' 9-5!

Today, annuloplasty rings have had more deaths associated with them during the past five years than any other device in their class, according to a Tribune analysis of FDA data on adverse events.

The weaker Europe becomes, the more it may drag down the rest of the world through three channels: damaged confidence and investment, fewer imports, and less credit to businesses and households.

The Cascade Policy Institute recently released a pharmaceutical industry-funded study that, unsurprisingly, supported the views of the industry. Cascade's Steve Buckstein also wrote a commentary trumpeting the study, which concluded that Oregon's law returning pseudoephedrine to a prescription drug was ineffective in reducing the use or manufacture of meth. But the study is fundamentally flawed, primarily because it relies on bad data and ignores key facts.

She's young enough that lowering her blood pressure now will prevent all the consequences of high blood pressure - artery hardening, heart attacks, strokes and damage to the vessels of the eyes.
There are pockets of hope. In Minnesota, resistance to building a new stadium for the Vikings has been fierce _ so much so that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell popped in the other day to deliver a not-so-subtle message. He surely let it be known that he's got Los Angeles on speed dial, ready to send them another team if the Land of a Thousand Lakes won't agree to pay for more than half of a $1 billion stadium that owner Zygi Wilf (estimated net worth: $1.3 billion) just has to have.

I don't blame the guy for not wanting to do an interview on a day in which he was wrestling with a big life decision. I don't blame him, either, for wanting that release. He's young, and he wanted to be closer to home. I will always wonder, however, what might have been for Seastrunk at Oregon. Because I believe the guy arrived on campus with major college football talent and was in an offense that would have eventually showcased it.

The pretty Hampshire village is where Austen was born in the rectory of her father's church in 1775. Like many places that have an early connection with a famous person's life, Steventon has less to offer the fan than hoped. It was the incubator of Austen's talents, but her literary life really started after she left town. The 13th century St. Nicholas church where her father was vicar still stands, though the rectory was torn down in 1828. The church bells are a 1995 gift from the Jane Austen Society of North America. Life in the small village shaped her country-centric attitudes. The Vyne, a great house in nearby Basingstoke that is now maintained by the National Trust, was the scene of the kind of parties that populate her books. Austen's father's decision to retire from the church and move in 1801 to the busy, expensive city of Bath came as culture shock to Austen, then 26. In what may be an apocryphally melodramatic story, Jane is said to have fainted dead away when her father broke what he thought was the happy news.
It's been a long time since I had the desire, or frankly, the stomach to follow our No. 2 stock exchange. And that's because of how its performance reflects on technology.

As for total population, it is possible that the 2000 Census was wrong, Fisher pointed out, and the recent count is valid. This year there are 269 students at the township’s K-6 school, which seem to bear out an under-18 population of 633 in the 2010 numbers.

Langella, to dredge up anecdotes that practically stretch back to Pola Negri, he kept a diary? “No. Absolutely not. I’ve never made one single note. And I don’t like computers. I wrote this longhand. Took a year from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.” How could he reprise so many memories? “Please. I’m an actor. That’s what I do. I memorize. I store things in my head. Total recall. If I saw you 10 years from now, I could recount everything you wore tonight.”

Serge (Ron Himes), a wealthy dermatologist, has just spent a small fortune on a modern painting: a huge white rectangle. The piece offends Marc (Tim Schall), who considers it the emperor's new painting. The third friend, Yvan (Robert A.

Nobody had to tell Sabathia that if ever there was a time for him to pitch up to his salary, this was it. The bullpen was taxed and folks in Yankeeland are starting to get very nervous about this rotation.

The Tigers saw only those 20 at-bats from the soon-to-be 35-year-old infielder this season, but they weren't pretty: two hits, no walks, a .100 average, six strikeouts. Last Thursday, the Tigers bet Inge wouldn't be a productive player again. He feels otherwise.
"We cannot raise premium costs to employers at this time," Morgenstern testified at a recent legislative informational hearing. Money to boost disability benefits can be found within the workers' comp system, he said.
Kalra finished with a shot to the groin. Saying that Measure B would impose unfair limits on disabled cops, he pointed out that Constant is getting a 50 percent disability pension, which he claimed was a sweeter deal than a cop in a wheelchair might get in certain cases.

“It’s such an important time,” said Bartschi, who was named the WHL's player of the week after he scored four goals with one assist in three games to help pace the Winterhawks to a 2-1 series lead. “I think everybody tries to play as hard as they can and as good as they can.

This year's contract talks between the UAW, Ford, Chrysler and General Motors later this summer promise to be especially complicated.

"In a perfect world, a year seems like a reasonable time for a young, well-educated person to get back on their financial feet, but it depends on their personal financial situation. If (they) have to go and pay off a bank or lost a home and lost a job, things can get pretty severe," said Hilary Martin, a certified financial planner at the San Jose-based Family Wealth Consulting Group. "Just having them move in with no (exit) agreement and kind of a hush-hush idea about money because you don't want to pressure them is not really a good idea. Be supportive but also have expectations."
He has pretty much been kissing babies. Is this a new game plan?
Methods vary. I tried more than a dozen recipes searching for the method I liked best. Several were more complicated than what I've described  managing all the individual components, at times hovering over the stove with a thermometer in one hand and a timer in the other, etc.  and it finally dawned on me (after I'd set my alarm so I could wake up on time to check on a batch of cheese incubating in the oven) that perhaps things need not be this complicated.

Yet many who aspire to build the next Facebook are learning from the mistakes of their guru, Mark Zuckerberg. His company was unprepared for the battle that erupted when Yahoo sued in March for infringing 10 patents.

Over there, they fought on the same side. Back here, they are on opposite sides. That's because Tommy (Chris Kerson) is pulled back into service for a crime lord engaged in a turf war with the drug-dealer brother of Darren (Will Blagrove). Their reentry proves to be as lethal as the worst days of their deployment. Legitimate job opportunities are scarcer than a playground with a hoop and net.

There's also a separate Museo Bardini, named after Stefano Bardini. Bardini was one of the first big-time art dealers — among his clients was Isabella Gardner, of the Boston museum — and Museo Bardini is filled with his personal collection.

Here's one example for reducing water use from my own experience. When we wanted hot water, say to take a shower or wash the dishes, we would turn on the faucet and wait – a long time – for the hot water to show up. We installed a water pump, with a timer, that keeps the water circulating at desired times, Turn on the faucet and the hot water arrives in about three seconds. I estimate this saves about 10 gallons of water every day, thus nearly 4,000 gallons a year. Multiply that by just 1,000 houses adding this feature, and the annual water consumption is reduced by 4 million gallons.
Finally, there's China. My readership in this spritely region of the world isn't as vocal as we'd all like, but Apple's doing gangbuster business there. So it's time for Mac OS to improve its support of China's unique quirks . . . both the country's linguistic ones and its political ones.

“The state does not have billions of extra dollars on hand, an undeniable consequence of continuously reckless spending and borrowing decisions and poor planning by past administrations,” he said. “The governor has repeatedly stated his recognition of the benefits of the project, but that does not change the current fiscal mess, which must be fixed before we could move forward with something of the size and cost of this project — which, by the way, was too heavily weighted in funding responsibility for New Jersey to begin with.”

I'm calling about Opinion Shaper Jeanie Ransom's column on cell phone use. I thought this article was very ridiculous and in bad taste. To bring up these accidents in the past was a very terrible thing to do. As a matter of fact, the bus accident on Interstate 44, the truck was actually not slowing but was stopped in a construction area when the bus hit it. Also, she said school bus drivers can use cell phones. School bus drivers cannot use cell phones in the district that I drive in. If we get caught using a cell phone, we get fired. If we get a phone call, what we can do is pull over to the side, take the call and then be on about our routes.

It's that way because the concept, with the nips and tucks for the American palate, is a proven winner.

Growing up in the aptly named Millstone, N.J., Chana sat up late at night as a child, ears tuned like an animal's, listening for the thud of her drugged, depressed mother hitting the floor.

While Gruber delivers the text, Sanderling and the orchestra will be occupied some of the time with a battery of toy instruments, from whirly tube to Swanee whistle, kazoo to bird warbler. "Paper bags will be blown up and burst,'' Gruber said. "It is not easy for the orchestra to remain poker-faced through all of this.''
Despite a growing embrace of environmentalism among many designers, so-called sustainable fashion continues to conjure notions of burlap. Awards show commentators rarely use the term — elegance just isn't synonymous with eco-friendly living.
"His contribution … to the nation, and indeed the world, is difficult to quantify because it is so wide-ranging," ANU Vice Chancellor Ian Chubb said in a statement. Nobel laureate Peter Doherty, who won the 1996 prize in medicine, has often said Fenner should have received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work eradicating smallpox "because they sometimes give the peace prize for enormous practical achievements."
There may be no female protagonist in literature as tragic as Lily Bart—and, yes, I include Anna Karenina when I say that. Beautiful, intelligent, "horribly poor—and very expensive," she knows what the upper echelons of 19th-century New York society demand of her: an advantageous marriage, a bargain in which she will provide the gilding and her husband the gold. And yet she twists in the net, resenting the bargain, knowing how to calculate what she needs to do but not calculating enough to seal the deal. ("For always getting what she wants in the long run, commend me to a nasty woman," says a friend who knows Lily is never nasty.) She dismisses the man she loves because he has no fortune, dismisses the man with the fortune because choosing him would compromise her principles, and finds herself finally with neither, nothing. Undone by envy, gossip and her own credulity, she slides down the mahogany banister of position and respectability. Wharton's first novel is like science fiction in reverse, a horrifying look back to an almost other-worldly time, in which a heroine of insight and sensitivity can cry, "What a miserable thing it is to be a woman."
While Eastlake Middle School choir member Emily Holman has faithfully watched each season of "Idol" since she was in pre-school, Cox acknowledged that this is the first year she has watched the show.

At the BZA meeting, Edward Morel, chairman of the BZA, said the question being asked was, “Do the general requirements trump the temporary sign? It says no inflatables. It’s spelled out. I don’t think you can get much clearer than that. I feel all signs in the township need to conform to the general regs (regulations). It’s pretty straightforward.”
Feb. 27: California Attorney General Bill Lockyer asks the state Supreme Court to stop San Francisco officials from issuing same-sex marriage licenses and invalidate gay and lesbian weddings that have taken place at City Hall since Feb. 12.
In Ben Rosenthal's "Ten High," set in a bar, two gangsters -- their dialogue a cross between Damon Runyon and David Mamet -- discuss an outlandish murder plot.

Hometown blues: When the Royals return home May 3, their 0-10 home record will be staring them in the eyes.
However, we should not pretend that the 50-50 split serves no purpose. Its purpose is to prevent MARTA from spending all of its sales tax revenue on personnel and salaries to the exclusion of adequately maintaining its extensive infrastructure.

Best of all is Winkie, who -- as voiced and manipulated by Paglino, the actor playing Clifford -- seems like a living, breathing teddy bear. His solo curtain call is well-deserved.

But the stress test as a 50th birthday present hasn't panned out, said Devries. "An abnormal stress test often leads to an angiogram which, if confirming a narrowed artery, often leads to a stent procedure," he said. "Unfortunately, placing stents in people who do not have symptoms has not been shown to prevent heart attacks or save lives."

øYahoo confirmed Thompson's credentials had been exaggerated in the recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company, which is based in Sunnyvale, California, brushed off the distortion as an "inadvertent error."
The pair allegedly have had a 10-year-affair (go ahead, do the math, shudder, and get back to me). Which is allegedly why Freeman's wife filed for divorce.
“The cops have to gain control of the streets with these layoffs coming and these guys knowing, it’s going to be suicide,” she said.
Loeb is trying to oust Thompson as he seeks four seats on Yahoo's board of directors — one for himself and three for his allies. Yahoo instead added three other directors in late March. Thompson told Loeb he wasn't qualified to be on the company's board.

What followed was a reign of terror - and error - ultimately resulting in Sterling, whose locked in litigation with Tri-City, being banished to a remote location during meetings; Chairwoman Reno proving to be completely incapable of controlling meetings; Coulter failing to counter charges that he preens over a worthless Ph.D.; and nurse Anderson being tarnished by allegations regarding prescription medicine.
Ultimately, the Garden - with its sustainable wine list, larger a la carte plates, and expansive cheese bar - needs to craft its own identity. But three head chefs into the adventure, I think Olexy has found a promising kitchen steward in Sean McPaul. A return visit in December produced a meal that was inspired by pristine ingredients first, not clever techniques, though most were rendered with elegant precision and focus: tortelloni stuffed with braised oxtail; duck with chestnuts in Madeira sauce; rustic leg of lamb with squash and olives; and tender gnocchi tossed with oozing Quadrello buffalo's milk cheese and charred Brussels sprouts.
Muschamp is still trying to fumigate a dilapidated program left behind by Urban Meyer - a program bereft of not only talent and depth but honor and discipline. Muschamp dismissed his best player, JanorisJenkins, from the team for a couple of pot arrests last year. Said Jenkins afterwards: "No doubt, if coach Meyer were still coaching, I'd still be playing for the Gators."

"The Godfather" is a sweeping saga of crime, punishment and the complexity of family ties. But it has its foodie side, too.
Abruptly, at least I felt it that way, our friendship ended. She would no longer stay in touch, and worse, she would not tell me what had happened. The chance to tell her that it doesn't matter to me what happened and if I did something I am so sorry is something I want to tell her.
While pizza is at the core of the menu, Pizzaiolo is so much more than a pizza parlor. The 31-year-old chef often creates polpette alla Pizzaiolo ($13), meatballs that may change daily -- chicken with tomato sauce on one occasion,
"This is the first time that we have a true group of seniors that have been with the program from the start," Beckman Coach TJ Prendergast.
All of these actions were denounced by the president, Leon Panetta, Hillary Rodham Clinton, talking heads and anyone else who might gain personal or political stature by declaring themselves appalled by such behavior. A Pentagon spokesman said that the "imagery of this conduct has the potential to indict all in the minds of local Afghans, inciting violence and perhaps causing needless casualties."

Mary Brereton said, "My father always complained to us that every day he had to stare at a blank piece of paper and create something seven days a week, but I think he enjoyed going to the office and the company of the people he worked with. He always talked about the 'characters' in his business. I think he loved it."

The insurance company that paid Dossman nearly $60,000 to repair the fire-damaged property is suing her, claiming she cashed the check and hasn't provided documentation for repairs, court documents show.

That night, I Bixied back to the Plateau for dinner at La Banquise, Montreal's best known shop for poutine. This local specialty — French fries topped with gravy and cheese curds — is hearty, delicious and awesome with beer, though try as I might, all my photos made it look like dog food. None of the hipsters around me seemed to mind, with lines out the door, particularly after 3 a.m., when bars close. La Banquise tops the standard poutine dozens of ways, most pretty meaty. I chose Galvaude, with peas and shredded turkey, and was stuffed two-thirds of the way through.

After Bumpus’s opinion is returned, the school district has 30 days to file a petition with the state to get one of the options on a ballot and out to voters. The consolidations question — which would be put out to Franklin Township and Elk voters — would need to pass in Franklin, plus have the majority of overall affirmative votes of all voters.
"You walk into any classroom, and there are automatic routines - you can tell by how kids walk the hallways, how they enter the classrooms," Johnstone said.

The committee said a number of statements News International executives made in 2009 were untrue, including the claim that illegal voice-mail interception was limited to one reporter and the assertion that phone hacking had been investigated thoroughly by the company. The report says News Corp.'s instinct throughout the affair was to "cover up rather than seek out wrongdoing and discipline the perpetrators."

Brewer said the borders still aren't secure and that the federal government should be moved quicker to do more to change that.
Competitors marvel at Bermingham's form, calling it a thing of beauty.
I don't know if I completely buy that story. But I've always liked it. That is why I suppose it's reasonable to consider "Trombone Shorty" a Joshua in reverse; a musical crusader who uses his trombone to restore the city walls that Katrina sought to destroy.
øHe signed with William Morris Agency and after appearing in small roles on multiple television shows, he landed the part of Goober Pyle on The Andy Griffith Show in 1964 - about two years after he first tried out for the role of Gomer Pyle, which was awarded to Jim Nabors. Lindsey acted on the show until it was canceled in 1968, and from there, he took the Goober character to the spinoff Mayberry R.F.D. The show was canceled in 1971. The comedy album won the attention of executives at country variety show Hee Haw, the actor's professional home for the next 20 years.

Nopales, the cactus, is unquestionably healthful, a source of vitamin C and potassium and bioflavonoids. Tortillas made with nopales taste basically like tortillas, although when it is time for a second round of tortillas, you may well opt for the regular ones, which are somewhat less puddingy inside. Cactus may well cure every disease you throw at it, as well as conquering childhood obesity and providing valuable manganese, but you are not going to change your lifestyle in one night.

A recipe this simple needs good-quality ingredients. Olympia uses a fortified sour cream that's not available to consumers. Full-fat Greek yogurt is a good substitute. Hickok recommends using a garlic press or a kitchen rasp for mincing the garlic. Never substitute garlic salt or garlic powder, he says.
But Howard made a late decision to remain in Orlando through next season, and the Nets scrambled to piece together a deal that could entice Williams to stay with them. Williams can opt out of his deal this summer and become an unrestricted free agent.

Edward, of course, was the king of England who gave up the throne for the twice-divorced American Simpson, making it either the greatest love story of the century or the spectacularly successful saga of a gold-digger, depending on your point of view. Madonna uses the film to tell the story from Simpson's side; several times characters note that everyone talks about what Edward gave up, but what about Simpson?
Their first hit, "A Fool in Love," was recorded in 1961. A 1971 cover version of John Fogerty's "Proud Mary" became their signature tune. Ike and Tina divorced in 1976.

My close friend has become the Patron Saint of Stressed Mothers over the last two years. All of the friends in our group have pitched in to help her adjust to this new lifestyle by baby-sitting, bringing over meals, listening patiently to all of HER problems, and politely tolerating her constant berating of her husband and own mother for the slightest child-rearing offense.
The issue was brought to the council's attention by the Howard County Association of Realtors.

A witness to Surf City’s ordeal, Harvey Cedars took a different approach. It wanted a contiguous dune line, the only way it would be effective against a storm surge. What easements the borough couldn’t get through negotiations, it obtained through condemnation. Municipal officials offered oceanfront homeowners what they considered fair market value for the strips of sand: $300 apiece. Objecting to what they felt was not just compensation, homeowners went to court. This time they didn’t sue over loss of privacy but rather over what they said was the lost value of their property because the new dunes blocked their ocean views — the most valuable asset of their homes.

In Romney prevailed in both Minnesota and Colorado in 2008, the first time he ran for the nomination, but the GOP has become more conservative in both states since then under the influence of tea party activists.

Capobianco’s pitch-perfect direction provided the animating soul of the evening. The dramatic action flowed smoothly back and forth across the stage, with winking references to song-and-dance numbers from golden-age Hollywood — a bit with Miersma and his fellow nobles, complete with canes and kicks, was a highlight of the staging, ironically funny but fully within the spirit of the piece. Seldom does a two-hour operetta fly by as fleet and light-hearted as this.

Board member Dalton Miller-Jones, a Portland State University psychology professor, seconded the motion to approve the tuition increases, but he noted, "This is really objectionable as a way to do business, to put this on the back of students."

Though Chamberlain is best known as the noble "Dr. Kildare" in the 1960s series that made him famous and for his leading roles in the 1980 miniseries "Shogun" and 1983's "The Thorn Birds," he is no stranger to theater. In fact, in 1959 he became one of the founders of the Company of Angels theater troupe, which is still in existence in downtown L.A.
I met Cameron at the insistence of Nicole Fama, one of the educators responsible for the remarkable transformation that has occurred at Arlington Woods over the past two years. She had told me Cameron exemplifies how much students are learning and thriving under the school's turnaround program, Project Restore. But he's something else as well: a symbol of the urgent need to get serious about improving all of Indianapolis' schools.
As he did in Florida, Romney was eager to take on the mantle of nominee-in-waiting when he spoke to supporters -- even though Gingrich, Santorum and Paul have said they intend to remain in the race.

Again, Oregon must resist the urge to attempt to suit up today and win last year's game. What's done is done. You can't unring Masoli's bell. And there's no amount of hitting, legal or not, that's going to change the outcome of the 2008 meeting.
USAToday wrapped its entire paper Monday with a full-size Jeep ad, meaning none of the "real" Page One was showing.
Your 17-year-old boy is not only still a minor, but also does not have the financial and institutional standing to support himself. Instead, he lives at home, becoming an adult incrementally on his parents' dime. It makes no sense for parents to absorb the money and decision-making burdens of adulthood while just handing their kids the perks. If Junior wants to play house, then he can rent house. If he doesn't like the back seat, then he can be abstinent.
The meta-study involved people with prehypertensive blood pressure levels, Sipahi said, and showed that the risk of stroke associated with these "normal yet high readings" can be altered by medication.

Consumers bought so much Jif Peanut Butter before a scheduled 30-percent price increase on Nov. 1 that the company ended up selling much less of it during the third quarter.
It's all part of an overall theme of uncertainty and regret, one that is best expressed by Kindermann's musings on his life's work, about what he views as "a peculiar irony at work in the world: what you lack will always be magnified by the people and events that constitute your life. A boy with no appreciation for food will be born into a family of cooks and live above a bakery. A woman who feels no kindness for her children will see, everywhere she goes, mothers and fathers fawning over their babies. So it was with him. He'd gravitated to a career as a summer camp director. All his life he'd been exasperated by other people's unwise longings."

McDiarmid acted beneath geological layers of latex. Worse: When he wasn't buried under rubber, he was performing opposite wood — namely Hayden Christensen, who does not have five decades on the London stage behind him. But like Timon, let's be generous here. While making the first "Star Wars," Harrison Ford famously told George Lucas: "You can type this (expletive), George, but you sure as hell can't say it." Indeed, few could. Alec Guinness could. And so could McDiarmid. He's been drippingly memorable.
Christie was initially vague about what he knew of the activities. When first asked about the disclosure, he called it "disturbing" and said he might have been briefed in 2007 but didn’t remember.

"Fifty Shades of Grey" and its sequels continue to sell well in St. Louis despite the cringe-inducing prose. (Note to romance readers: Many modern romance novels offer sex scenes. Surely dozens are better written than "Fifty Shades.")
So far, Booker’s greatest success has been garnering $43 million in matching funds to the Facebook donation, but the pitfalls surrounding private donations in schools came to light last week when it was discovered that part of a $500,000 grant from the Broad Foundation funded a proposal to "co-locate" new district and charter schools with more than a dozen current schools. The plan was obtained by The Star-Ledger and rankled parents and educators who felt they had been misled.
Which brings us to 2012, where, with his eighth team in his 25th big-league season, Moyer made his first appearance Saturday in nearly 21 months — adding to his MLB record for homers allowed (513) — in a 7-3 loss to the Astros. But in his next start, he could become the oldest player in MLB history to win a game. And when I’m dead a quarter-century from now, I just hope ESPN Afterlife has highlights of a 74-year-old Moyer breaking Cy Young’s career record for wins.
That's familiar territory for Kansas. There have been 21 such meetings in Big 12 history, and KU has been involved in 15 of them. It would be Baylor's first such contest.
4. Jon Diebler is as poised as ever to be a factor. He’s made the most 3-pointers in Big Ten history (370), hitting 46.6% of his attempts from beyond the arc. Against a Kentucky team that will likely sell out on Sullinger to try and limit points in the paint, look for Diebler to get early shots.

Marijuana is indelibly associated with food, whether it is chemotherapy patients using the drug to try to develop an appetite, or, farcically, a couple of stoners with an overpowering case of the munchies in "Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle."

What was not disclosed at the time is that the agreement specifically requires Motorola Mobility to retain a workforce here of 2,500 workers.

Petzel, strikingly well-organized in his positions for a newbie candidate so young, also has a strong background in environmental issues, having been a leader in Fox River preservation issues since he was a teenager. He claims credit for writing a state law that banned gravel mining in forest preserves. Perhaps it's not surprising, then, that Petzel is particularly specific in his proposals to promote renewable and clean-energy sources. He calls for permanent tax credits to producers of renewable energy such as wind and solar, low-interest loans to expand transmission lines for renewable energy, and a congressional mandate that 25 percent of all American electricity be produced from renewable sources by 2025.

Kohnstamm: There's one basic principle that is behind the right to be forgotten: One of the most important things for human beings is that they have the right to grow older, to change their habits, to evolve and develop in different ways.
And somehow, it has evolved into his kind of team, playing his brand of football — if you just walked the field before this one, you’d understand it. You could hear an audible squish with each footstep. It was a grimy, sloppy mess, a game of precision played in a big gooey bog, and it made for an entertaining show if you happen to like defense.

Rockies catcher Ramon Hernandez had a tough time at the dish Friday night. He was fine behind the plate, but reaching home was another matter. He threw a short temper tantrum in the fourth inning after being tagged out by catcher Jonathan Lucroy.

In the sixth, Hernandez was tagged out trying to score from third on Chris Nelson's infield grounder.

It all builds to a climax that shatters more than simply the fragile Roger Moore pastiche that Chris has pieced together as his own notion of a hip persona. So far, so McCabe-like: Readers familiar with his work may begin to feel that they've been here before -- that Chris is an awful lot like Francie Brady of "The Butcher Boy," just a little further down the line. Stop there, and things seem entertaining -- McCabe is incapable of not telling an interesting story -- if a bit disappointing, particularly when measured against "Winterwood," the brilliant novelistic exploration of Ireland's new national identity that the author published two years ago.

Dillon compared the situation to putting an asterisk next to a record-breaking sports statistic earned under unusual circumstances.
Hales: This is so critical. I've talked to so many parents going door to door campaigning for this office who really want to maintain support for public schools in Portland. But there's quite a bit of fatigue among those parents who have had to have auction after auction to keep the arts program in their neighborhood school. We have been holding education together with duct tape and bake sales in this city. That's commendable for those activists, but fatiguing as well. We have to put education on firm footing. Arts and culture have to be part of that basic understanding of what school will provide for kids. So that's why I keep coming back to education. If our kids aren't artists by the time they graduate from high school, the odds they'll care about the arts and have the joy of experiencing it in their adult life is pretty low. I raised my kids with an appreciation for the arts. I'm proud of them. My daughter is a modern dancer, working in New York. My son is a stage manager at Milagro, as I mentioned. That's important to me.
Trust me, the moralist in me would love to see the Tigers either release Young or bench him until this whole mess is over. He may be innocent until proven guilty in a court of law, but hes undoubtedly guilty of terrible judgment at a time when his team needs him badly. But we dont get to be the judge and the jury. We can certainly pass judgment and weve heard plenty of people do that over the last 72 hours. But we dont get to read a police report and leap to the preposterous conclusion that the Tigers should "do the right thing:"" and dump Young immediately. In fact, if MLB determines that hes clear to play, he should be back in the lineup as soon as Jim Leyland wants him there.

But John Scherer must be commended for what he does with Robert. The squeaky-voiced and nervous character is a skimmed milquetoast. Scherer amuses with each eyeroll and gulp, en route to having all his fuses blown. Good that this was the era when men carried handkerchiefs, for Scherer needs his quite often to mop his brow. He often has his hand over his heart, probably to see if it’s still ticking.
"True Blood" (9 p.m. Sunday, HBO): One thing you have to say about executive producer Alan Ball's supernatural cable drama -- it's rarely in danger of repeating itself. Each plot-packed season has its distinct themes and emotional shadings. The fourth season went seriously bump in the night with last week's graveyard showdown between the vampires and Marnie's spell-casting witches. Sookie (Anna Paquin) was injured. Bill (Stephen Moyer) was captured. And the eerie battle is brewing into a war.
 A teacher at Hiram Johnson High School, noting scratches on Lilly's face and arms, referred her to the school nurse in November 2006.

_ "Alien" (1979): This belongs at the top of about five different lists, including best thriller and best horror film, as well. Ridley Scott did so many things right here — from the grimy, lived-in world of the Nostromo mixed with H.R. Giger's eerily seductive design to the perfect cast and Sigourney Weaver's bad-ass performance. I also love the way Scott keeps the alien unseen for so much of the gut-churning build up, then delivers one of the most terrifying creatures ever seen on screen. I still can't watch this one after about 8 p.m.

I know next to nothing about astronomy, but still the sky fills me with wonder. The stars linger in the galaxies, fixed on high light years away. They lead me to wonder about the breadth of God's providence and grace. They shine with brilliance, but also mystery.

A low-budget take on the 1950s Starkweather-Fugate murder spree (the same crimes that also inspired Terence Malick's "Badlands"), director George Hood's movie, filmed in Portland in 1974, was nationally distributed with the title "Stark Raving Mad," and today is difficult to find anywhere. It's worth seeing for its place in Oregon film history alone: long before today's fertile, celebrated film scene, here was an independent feature production starring Portland actors and using mostly Portland crew members. Hood and producer-writer Don Gronquist will be on hand to present the movie.

Do you gloat when you've gotten the best of someone in an argument over a parking space? If you've told someone off, are you gleeful? If so, then you are exhibiting bullying behavior. Think about it. You could end bullying by behaving like an adult and expressing disapproval of bullying behavior — and stop watching those damn reality shows!

TBI can worsen the symptoms of people who already have PTSD or who go on to develop it because of, say, a near-fatal bomb explosion.

Not long ago Scott was able to change units almost the way hockey coaches do lines and defensive pairings. Not with the injuries, though. And, I think it's starting to have an impact on their brutal second quarters. The Cavs are dead last in second-quarter scoring with 20.3 points per game. Any wonder why they are needing big fourth-quarter comebacks?
Huff recalled a meeting at Wrigley Field in late September when Renteria began crying, telling his teammates he wanted to win one more time.

I think we might be seeing him speak in public more often, and show a different style than his father."
Paterson had planned to honor Cruz with a ticker-tape parade and a key to the city on Feb. 12, only a week after the Giants defeated the New England Patriots, 21-17, in Indianapolis.

He readily concedes that substance abuse and addiction are devastating. He ticks off his own examples: His father and a son have alcohol problems, his daughter was treated for heroin addiction and his brother died at 40 from alcoholism. His own junk food addiction caused him to balloon to 380 pounds before he had stomach surgery, changed his habits and got down to 200 pounds.
Healthy sperm and a robust sperm count improve your odds that a single sperm will survive its ultra-marathon journey and meet an eligible egg. And sperm have different functions. Some act like blockers to stop other sperm, which makes "survival of the fittest" sense for animals with multiple mates during rutting season, while others are sprinters designed to beat a path to the egg. More than half of a guy's sperm are the sprinter/swimmer type and those oval heads need to be strong enough to break through an egg's tough outer layer.

The district voted in January 2010 to charge homeowners, schools, businesses and churches, based on the amount of hard surface on their property.

Mr. Romney wants to change Medicaid funding from an open-ended entitlement to a block grant system, thereby limiting the federal government's exposure to health care costs. The Affordable Care Act, on the other hand, expands Medicaid to 17 million more low-income Americans, at a cost to states and the federal government.

There were standard repertoire albums this year, but the best of the releases tended to be a little more unusual. New compositions that spoke poignantly to contemporary life and underappreciated works by 20th-century composers made for intriguing listening.

The 2010 healthcare reform law gave states until Jan. 1, 2014, to create "exchanges" in which individuals and small businesses could shop for insurance policies. If the states don't, the federal government will operate exchanges for them. The requirement poses a quandary for lawmakers who oppose the federal law: Should they start working on an exchange, or count on the law being repealed by the Supreme Court or by a new Republican-controlled Congress and White House in 2013? The answer is that each state should set up an exchange regardless of how its lawmakers feel about "Obamacare," because it would help ameliorate the very real problems consumers face in the health insurance market.

In particular, researchers point to prisoners of war on terror-related activities as potential subjects for the fMRI lie-detecting methods. Greely and Wolpe agree that there is "little doubt" the U.S. government has been studying them. "We have a technology now that, under certain circumstances and in certain ways, allows us to look at activities of the brain and deduce things that previously we never could have understood from a person without communicating with them," Wolpe said.

After, as the group walked up to the hotel doors, Young started yelling anti-Semitic epithets, police said.
Early experiences taught Keller to treat each ingredient with care and respect. He recalls the time he accidentally snapped the leg of a rabbit when he reached into the cage to grab it and didn't have a proper grip. He still remembers the squeal of pain, but that gruesome incident became a defining moment in shaping his approach to food -- every element is treated with dignity, and cooked in a way that celebrates it. Keller is one of the most thoughtful and precise of chefs, and it shows in every preparation. He's so exacting and particular that he has designed just about every plate and serving piece in the restaurant. About a year ago, he raised his menu price from $115 to $175, and recently also added an automatic gratuity, which is split among the staff -- much as Chez Panisse has been doing for years. While the price is formidable, with Keller's culinary genius and Laura Cunningham's front-of-the-house magic, the experience is well worth the extra dollars. The menu changes anywhere from 30 to 60 percent a night, depending on what's fresh that day.

As Cooper tells it, he first tasted mezcal in the 1970s while road-tripping through Mexico. On return trips to Oaxaca, where most mezcal is made, he sought out palenqueros, or mezcal makers, and collected rare bottles.

Copeland argued that in the Webster Groves case, St. Louis County Circuit Court Judge Barbara Wallace denied the school district a hearing before ordering in June that King-Willmann be immediately enrolled.

Kamala Harris is pushing lawmakers to incorporate some of the lessons learned into a new state law governing foreclosures, but lenders are resisting, arguing that the mortgage meltdown was just a "temporary" crisis that doesn't justify a permanent change in law. That's wishful thinking, and legislators should give troubled borrowers more protection against lenders' procedural shortcuts.

This coming year will be different in Beaverton. Our 2012-13 budget proposal is focused on supporting a more strategic, consistent, equitable and sustainable K-12 educational system. The budget proposal is painful, and the decisions are difficult. It will be hard on our staff. It will be hard on our students. It will be hard on the community. Yet, I know we have the strength to get through this. True resolve is shown during times of adversity. We must consider new paradigms, foster healthy and innovative schools, and focus on transformative solutions. I am calling on our community to co-labor our challenges and to recommit to our schools and children.

But the 2.8 percent annualized growth rate in the October-December quarter -- the fastest pace since the spring of 2010 -- isn't being cheered by most economists or investors.

Sometimes a person's "mom food" isn't even one that mom made, just one that's associated with her. Gabrielle Hamilton's mom was a great, but "challenging" cook, says the chef-owner of Prune in New York's East Village.

My dad was a Realtor, and he and my mom were pretty much too wrapped up in raising eight kids to worry about me and my brothers banging on instruments. My brother Danny and I use to jam in our attic and drive them crazy. Worse than that, all my other brothers and half of the neighborhood thought they were drummers and would bang on the kit whenever they could. Nothing worse than bad drummers making a racket on a drum kit! I think in the last 10 years or so, both my parents came to the realization that this "music thing and me" was not going to go away.
My will named a relative as guardian, but did not name his wife. That's not ideal, Kruss and I agreed. Later, I realized LegalZoom had asked me whether I wanted to add a co-guardian, but did so only several screens after I'd already selected one. So I overlooked my chance.

Meanwhile Heinrich, who has sworn revenge on FDR and Tuck, makes his way to the U.S. However, "meanwhile" implies that this is an actual subplot.

By "Fables of the Reconstruction," (1985) the band's third album, the haze was lifting. R.E.M. became defenders and poets of the American south, incorporating elements of colloquial speech into its songs ("Good Advices," "Can't Get There From Here") . Stipe also became an ardent critic of the Reagan Administration. "Document," the band's most overtly political album, was also its commercial breakthrough. Released in the wake of the Iran-Contra scandal, "Welcome to the Occupation" assailed American intervention in Central America; "Exhuming McCarthy" drew a connection between the Red Scare and then-contemporary foreign policy; "Disturbance at the Heron House" poked fun at the arrogance of the establishment. "It's the End of the World As We Know It" was not an explicitly political song, but it shook the skeleton of Bob Dylan's "Subterranean Homesick Blues."

Rating: TWO AND A HALF STARS NV Schramsberg Mirabelle North Coast Brut Rosé ($24) This may be a good transitional wine to Champagne, as one panelist noted.

A touch herbal, oxidative and astringent at moments, it nonetheless is interesting and refreshing.

Colt McCoy is destined to be a better "real" quarterback than fantasy quarterback. He has all the intangibles you want in a team leader, but lacks the arm strength to air it out with the big guns. Add in his underwhelming wide receiver corps and the degree of difficulty in playing outdoors in the winter, and McCoy will be a bye-week substitute at best.

For the parsnip cream: Meanwhile, place parsnips in large stockpot and cover with cream. Simmer until the parsnips are very tender, stirring occasionally and pressing down to compact the parsnips so all are covered, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool slightly. Working in batches, puree in a blender until smooth. (If the mixture is still very hot, fill blender only about halfway.) Pass through a fine mesh strainer into a bowl. Add 3/4 cup water (more, if needed) until the warm parsnip cream has the consistency of moderately thin gravy. Season to taste with salt, pepper and lemon juice. The parsnip cream can be made a day ahead; keep warm if using right away.

Tough one. There are some great movies about musicians and some great documentaries. I tend to like the documentaries. I recently watched a documentary on Chet Baker, "Let's Get Lost," and that was very insightful. As far as movies go, "Bird" was good, "Ray" was cool, so was "For Love or Country" (story of Arturo Sandoval), and "Sweet and Lowdown" (a Woody Allen film about a fictional gypsy jazz guitarist), so many others. Not really a "movie," but I've been diggin' on "Stevie Wonder Live at Last" recently.

I'm not a poster child. I'm not a rebel. I am a priest. While it pains me that not all of my Christian brothers and sisters are able to recognize that as an objectively and theologically true statement, perhaps now is not the time to insist on recognition-or worse, to instigate conflict. For my husband and me, this trip is a celebration of family and faith, a time to be with people we love in one of the most beautiful and exciting cities on earth. There's no need to try to make it about me.

Mindful shopping at farmers markets involves many factors that often compete with one another and rarely align perfectly.

This work gives me everything. It has given me a real reason to live. I have goals for the animals that sometimes seem insurmountable. I've been able to get one federal bill passed in Washington to stop the interstate traffic of big cats. I co-authored the bill and took it to my congressmen. I don't know how anyone can have lions and tigers as pets. They are predators. Our government says it's OK to breed these animals and sell them. My goal is to get a billed passed to stop the breeding. So many adults and children are either killed or injured by these animals. It's totally our fault.

Mattaliano's opera fundamentalism overcame his deficits as a newbie general director. He may have been the least qualified candidate being considered to lead Portland Opera when Robert Bailey retired in 2003. An itinerant stage director at Juilliard, Yale, Princeton, the Metropolitan and New York City Opera companies for 25 years, he knew stages, not boardrooms. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of opera -- call him an opera savant -- but his only experience leading a company was a small summer music festival on Michigan's Upper Peninsula.

Actually, though I agree Boozer has lacked some explosiveness this season, I think he finished the year very well. He was very aggressive in that Knicks game and while he did bobble some shots and passes, players talked about the ball being slick that game. Also, he's been consistently drawing double-teams and finding the open man. I don't think he gets enough credit for his passing. As the Bulls like to say, that's easy offense.

In the 1970s and '80s, he made short trips to northern Mexico, landing on runways marked by burning tires, and made long flights through the Sierra Madre, where joyous farmers rode alongside his plane on horseback, shooting pistols into the air.

Thursday marked the third day of 2012 NFL free agency, and the Buffalo Bills finally landed their primary target. Although the Bills’ signing of defensive end Mario Williams—the best defensive player on the market—was the biggest move, the Dallas Cowboys stayed busy addressing the back seven of their defense.
A: Honda says it is not planning to develop a direct replacement for the Element. However, the car maker has been guiding fans of the discontinued vehicle to its new CR-V compact crossover. Of course if you (and your dog) try one out you'll see that the CR-V's interior space isn't as "perfect" for pets, bikes and other gear as the Element's.

Bill Hannegan, a leading critic of smoking bans, acknowledged Lindsey's tenacity. But he said her group overreaches in seeking to strengthen a ban that he said already goes too far.
Despite its terribly artful and plush staging, "Finding Neverland" never managed to get around the quiet, solitary and anti-dramatic nature of writing. At least it spared us painful scenes of Johnny Depp as Barrie toiling over a manuscript, opting instead for sudden depictions of his fertile imagination, seen as if through his mind's eye. Yet, for all its intelligence, this movie in the end settles for being a high-end tear-jerker. Somehow, I was hoping for more revelation — and even, I admit, a rosebud or two. Instead, Barrie, in Depp's muted portrayal, remains as remote as he likely was in real life.

Meanwhile, remember that the average American uses double the energy of the average European! Why? Because we keep our house a lot hotter in the winter and a lot colder in the summer, we drive huge SUVs and pickup trucks for just one person, and we insist on leaving them running while we wait for our kids outside school, go into the 7-11 for our coffee and cigarettes and while waiting for our spouses who are shopping.

It may be a prejudice, but people are continually surprised to find this caliber of restaurant in the Westin Hotel on Third Street just off Market. I can't tell you how many times people have written me to let me know they were skeptical but became converts after tasting Richard Corbo's take on rustic Venetian-inspired food. His specialties include a stellar sformato, a dense souffle made with lobster and ground polenta when I visited; perfectly done arancini (risotto balls); and halibut cheeks with polenta and jalapeno-mint marinara. With a sexy interior and one of the best outdoor spaces in the city, it's a great addition to the dining scene.

"People like and pay more for experts," points out the brand manager.
The coal industry and its loyal servants in Congress are crying foul, and are pursuing a two-pronged strategy: seeking to pass legislation to block the proposed rule, and using it as political ammunition against President Obama by pretending it would kill jobs. Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) has vowed to introduce a resolution to overturn the rule, while the pro-industry Institute for Energy Research calls it an "assault on American energy" that will push companies out of business by discouraging development of affordable coal power.
Republican Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin suggested that some political appointees at Justice should be removed immediately, and asked Holder when he was going to "clean up this mess." He added, "If you don't get to the bottom of this," the only other option might be "impeachment."

The players say they won't accept a hard cap. NHL players felt the same way until a labor dispute ate up the entire 2004-05 season. Hockey has never recovered in the United States, becoming the sport of Claude Rains -- "The Invisible Man" -- unless you have the Versus cable TV channel. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, Stern's former top lieutenant, not only led the bitter hockey fight, he returned with a hard cap and "cost security" on payrolls.
In 2009, GE Capital Finance was the largest segment by revenue, but it was hurt by problems in its holdings and commercial real estate lending.

These days the “boyfriend” in question may be purely rhetorical. Theron recently split from her partner, actor Stuart Townsend, after 10 years together. The breakup was a painful one which, she’s admitted, is why she’s been off the screen for a while; trying to avert a split and make the relationship work was her real priority. And Theron has no problem with focusing on a goal.

The study involved 22 men with prostate cancer. All of them were scheduled to have their prostates removed, and some of them took metformin for about seven weeks beforehand. After the prostates were excised, researchers from Toronto compared them and found that tumors grew more slowly in men who took the diabetes drug than in men who didn’t.

Greece's embattled prime minister faces a crucial vote of confidence in parliament later Tuesday. If the vote fails, it would throw into doubt whether Greece will implement new austerity measures required for the next $17 billion in aid from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.

"Farther Away" offers a series of takes on the actual life, as filtered through Franzen's abiding obsessions: literature, birding and (yes) himself. I'm tempted to add Wallace to that list, since the book, or part of it anyway, exists in both his real and metaphorical shadow; among his most widely read essays is an earlier Kenyon commencement address. But if, at times, Franzen himself seems to want to frame the collection as his side of an ongoing discussion with his dead friend about art and life and the necessity of engagement - "I understood," he writes at one point, "the difference between his unmanageable misery and my manageable discontents to be that I could escape myself in the joy of birds and he could not" - that is, ultimately, too reductive a lens.

Alsop gets out of that jam, but the encounter looms over the entire show, which takes us to 1968. It’s on our minds as we watch Alsop interact with his wife, Susan Mary (Margaret Colin), and the made-up character of stepdaughter Abigail (Grace Gummer).

A. I wrote this memoir for my father. When he died in 1988, there was a big funeral. I was 24 and very arrogant. I was supposed to deliver a speech. I was better educated than he was. My father wanted to teach me the traditional ways to do things and I wanted to find new ways. I thought I was better than him. At the funeral, I just went up and bowed to the mourners. I didn’t say a word. As I approached middle age, I started to understand my father. I owed my father a eulogy. I wrote the book in an attempt to re-evaluate my father’s life and my family.

How might you know that Canadian folk-rocker Roxanne Potvin used to be a blues singer? Perhaps you can tell by how well she’s able to make effective, compelling music from the most rudimentary materials. Many of the songs on “Play” are little more than a simple, repetitive melody sung in Potvin’s modest voice, some sandpaper guitar and a straightforward drumbeat. The French-language “Dis-Moi Que Tu M’Aimes” is little more than a shout, a swirling Farfisa riff and a few well-timed halts by the rhythm section; somehow, it’s irresistible. “Pretty Girls” repeats its title over and over like a drawled mantra — it’s more hypnotic Velvet Underground than modern pop. “Let Me Go” is little more than a blurt, but it’s certainly an arresting one. Potvin keeps things punchy by getting in and out of her songs quickly — several tracks on “Play” barely break the two-minute mark. It’s all such fun that by the time she drops her languid cover of Right Said Fred’s “I’m Too Sexy” on you at the conclusion of the album, you’ll barely mind. Fans of Liz Phair’s early insouciance and Lucinda Williams’ occasional whimsy should search this out.

A. Well, luckily they were both Ford vehicles. When we close the books on August, we will set an all-time sales record for Fusion, Flex and the highest sales on F-150 trucks since October 2006. Clearly for the rest of the year, we will see a slower sales pace than we have seen the past four to six weeks. We expect this year the industry will sell between 10.5 million and 11 million units, still down from last year, and about 12.5 million next year.

He said he found himself moved by the experience of listening to the testimony of same-sex couples and their families, and of watching them as they pleaded their case before legislators during a committee hearing. What he observed was simple and unmistakable: love. He heard it in the witnesses' voices, and he saw it in their small, unconscious gestures of affection. He saw the love of two people who have dedicated their lives to one another, and more crucially, he saw the love of parents for their children. Mr. Kach said he is a pro-life legislator, and for him, that means making sure all children are taken care of: "I hope all of you that especially care about children will think of them and hopefully as a state all our children are going to have the same rights."
