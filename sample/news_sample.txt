Not good for a team that could really use extra picks to continue to build around their core of players.

Will 2012 finally be the year when the camera industry settles on one name for a common next-generation style of camera? They'd better get hopping. These new cameras could kill off the consumer SLR by 2013.

The Matthews Band is frequently compared to the Grateful Dead, but that's misleading. All the group shares with the Dead is a mass audience, a taste for syncopation, and a propensity to indulge in long solos. Really, Matthews is best understood as the inheritor of '80s globetrotting pop-rock: David Byrne, Sting, and especially Paul Simon, all of whom found room in their otherwise mainstream material for foreign influences: Caribbean reggae, Cuban jazz, African pop, Brazilian samba. The Caravan lineup featured many acts that shared Matthews' open-mindedness, omnivorous musical appetites, and, to be fair, willingness to sell exotic tropes to a mostly white, politically engaged, college-educated audience searching for answers to knotty problems.

Looking for a meatless entree, I could have ordered the broiled orange roughy ($14.95) with sauteed mixed vegetables. Not being a roughy fan, I picked the crab cakes marinara ($9.95).

The beauty of HbA1C lies in its ability to tell you how well or badly controlled your blood sugar was in the previous two to three months. It indicates the average value of your sugar in that period. The advantage of this is a clearer picture of whether medicine, diet and activity are keeping your sugar in a safe range. A single measurement of sugar can be misleading. It provides information on only a very short time span. It doesn't provide the big picture that HbA1C does.

The city's annexation plans are a bad deal for Seminole County residents, who are happy with county services, and for Casselberry residents, who will forgo the subsidy the water surcharge provides.

Set on the coast of New Zealand in 1984, this comedy-drama is about an 11-year-old kid, a devout Michael Jackson fan, who finally gets a chance to know the father he has long idolized. Dad, however, has been serving time in prison, and the reunion doesn't go quite as expected. Taika Waititi, who wrote, directed and stars as the ne'er-do-well dad, makes the film heartfelt and heartbreaking. He tells the story in inventive ways, with animation, fantasy sequences and other offbeat devices.

A: You were "walked" to another hotel, which is a fairly common practice in the hotel industry.

So yes, the world has changed. The competition for jobs is real. But this shouldn’t discourage us. It should challenge us. Remember – for all the hits we’ve taken these last few years, for all the naysayers predicting our decline, America still has the largest, most prosperous economy in the world. No workers are more productive than ours. No country has more successful companies, or grants more patents to inventors and entrepreneurs. We are home to the world’s best colleges and universities, where more students come to study than any other place on Earth.

3. When returning home after traveling, inspect purses, bags, luggage and other materials for signs for bedbugs. Take luggage and other items immediately to the laundry room instead of the bedroom, just in case you've missed anything. Washing clothing in hot water (at least 120 degrees) and drying in a hot dryer for at least 30 minutes kills bugs, nymphs and eggs. If items cannot be washed, place the dry items into the hot dryer for a minimum of 30 minutes for disinfection.

_ "Edward Scissorhands" (1990): Burton and Depp's first film together and one that still strikes a wistful, poignant tone after all this time. I still can't decide whether this fairy tale is sweetly dark or darkly sweet. Either way, Depp is delicate and lovely as the misunderstood title character, the creation of an inventor who died before his work was complete, leaving Edward to fend for himself in the outside world with scissors for hands. While many initially fear him as a monster, he's actually a gentle creature who falls hopelessly in love with Winona Ryder's idealized, fair-haired teenager. Burton's candy-colored vision of suburbia finds just the right satirical tone, and the ending gets me every time.
"Sitting at home against BYU was kind of heartbreaking for me," Pulfer said. "I vowed then that I wasn't ever going to sit at home again."

A few days ago, they broke ground on a new palace for the San Francisco 49ers. The good folks in Los Angeles are just clamoring to plop down $800 million or so if the NFL will give them another chance.

So, statistics obviously matter, but team success does, too. However, for these purposes, that element has been eliminated – let's just say I'm projecting the Ducks to remain prominent, essentially Rose Bowl or bust. And if that happens, the offense will likely remain dynamic, which means Barner and/or Thomas is being productive.

MH: Books about the Templars fall into two categories. Some are strictly history and confine themselves to the two centuries of the Templars' existence. Others are speculative and deal in the many stories surrounding the Templars, in what you might call the afterlife of the Templars that continues in the popular imagination to this day. I wanted to take a serious look at both the history and the mythic afterlife and to show how they are intimately related and always have been -- how the Templars became the subject of popular imagination already at their inception, celebrities, you might say, the superstars of the Middle Ages.
"I look at that a little different than some people. You mention Jake Delhomme, Jake played in the league a long time and when he couldn't play anymore because of the injury he wanted to do something. He wanted to. That coaching staff allowed him to take an active role, almost to the point of being an assistant coach. If I was still coaching I wouldn't do that. The mentor thing is overblown to me. I'm going to coach the player. I'm not going to have another player coach the player. They can be friends but when it comes to what I want him to do on the football field, that's my call not another player's call. So when Seneca said that and I know Seneca as well as anybody because he played for me, he is a good guy who wants to play football and is a very good player and has always been in a certain role but given the chance he has performed pretty well. Last year none of our quarterbacks had the supporting cast that we needed to get around them. His comments didn't bother me at all. I don't expect any of those guys to be mentors to anybody. I'm the mentor or the coach is the mentor."

"We are the students of Sacred Heart High School. We feel our school has been closed unfairly. We were just blindsided by the news; we recieved this morning. In the middle of class, we were called to the gym and made to wait for fifteen minutes to find out what was going to happen. This would not have been as surprising if we had some kind of warning. However, we were outright told, in simple term(s), "The bishop has decided to close your school. Find somewhere else to go." This news came three days before midterms. Right in the middle of one of our most successuful sports seasons. Right before one of our most popular events, the Snowball (dance). Our students are devastated by this news, and we are trying to fight. We plead with you to help us. Our school is not just a school; it is a family. Our students are extremely close. We support each other in everything. We are always there for one another. This news has hurt us, but we are not broken. We refuse to go down without a fight. We love our school, and we don't want to go anywhere else. This school is our home. We love this school and will do anything it takes to reverse this decision."

A funny thing happened while MIT researchers were testing the effects of yogurt on obese mice -- unexpected side effects sprouted up. First, yogurt-fed mice developed thick, shiny fur, with 10 times the hair-follicle density of their yogurt-deprived counterparts. And then researchers noticed that their fur wasn't all that seemed fuller.

The yogurt-eating males also inseminated their partners faster (and yogurt-eating females gave birth to larger and more successful litters).

Asked about the issue of corruption in the state, Marra said: "There are easily reforms that could be made within this state that would make our job easier, or even take some of the load off our job. There are too many people that profit off the system the way it is and so they have no incentive to change it. The few people that want to change it seem to get shouted down. So how long that cycle's going to continue I just don't know."

Recent visitors have noticed that parking has become tight due to new construction that's taken some lots out of circulation. Parking hasn't been this bad since the expanded Winchester garage opened in 2009.
Both observers also highlighted the division between the center (big downtown performing arts venues, gleaming commercial galleries) and the fringe (out-of-the-way theaters, funky alternative exhibit space). Hicks essentially praised the arts scene here for continuing to do more and more with a little, but wonders if the broader community will appreciate that enough to help out. Plagens seemed to suggest that there’s an inherent contradiction in Portland’s indie-minded ethos and its unspoken ambition (“To be blunt, Portland's art scene has a lot of no-no on its lips but yes-yes in its eyes”).
They're also growing quite accustomed to playing tight ones: 10 of their 11 playoff games have been decided by one goal, and only once has Washington scored as many as four.

Previous reports have suggested that amnesty would be handled as a "stretch exception" -- one that would let teams waive a player, but stretch his salary cap hit over double the length of the remainder of the deal, plus one year. So if a player is owed $12 million over two seasons, he could be waived, and although he would still have to be paid, his cap hit could be stretched to five years at $2.4 million each year.
In the case of “Tiny Toons,” Warner Bros. made an old favorite new again without changing the formula, just the subjects. “Tiny Toons” was the first collaboration between Steven Spielberg and Warner Bros. The partnership was so successful, especially among adults, that “Animaniacs” quickly followed. Just like the original, these shows were a blend of sight gags, wackiness, pop culture references, and stylized, animated violence.

Safety T.J. McDonald and tackle George Uko were defensive standouts Thursday. ... Kiffin, when asked about the Trojans' defense being ahead of the offense so far, said, "I think the gap's closing." Then he paused for a moment and said, "I just used that term. Never used that. The gap closed." Last November, a few days before USC played UCLA, former UCLA coach Rick Neuheisel said, "We have closed the gap more with 'SC." The Trojans won, 50-0.

Pizzeria Ortica in Costa Mesa puts more emphasis on the pizzas, though the menu also offers the gamut of antipasti, salads, pastas and main courses. This is Sona and Comme Ça owner David Myers' first foray into Italian, with Steve Samson, whom you might remember as chef at Valentino a few years back, as chef de cuisine. Samson has made it his business to get the dough right, using a 300-year-old biga or sourdough starter from outside Naples, Italy (wonder how he got that baby through customs?). The thin crust has wonderful flavor and picks up some smokiness from the oven. Consider the Calabrese with San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, rapini, hot little Calabrese peppers and shaved bottarga (dried pressed roe). The Margherita is classic, and you can add prosciutto and wild arugula to it, or salami and mushrooms. But the most unusual is the pie topped with fresh ricotta, guanciale, scallions and a dusting of fennel pollen. The place also has some terrific antipasti, such as house-cured yellowfin tuna with borlotti beans, charred octopus with potatoes and celery or carciofi (artichokes) alla Romana. Note: On the first and third Saturday of every month, Samson will be teaching a pizza class at the restaurant.

As I recall, they were going to have a new investor by the end of 2010, then again by Feb. or Mar. or something. In this informal setting, do you have anything additional to offer that suggests that this time around, yes, they actually meant it? Even just a gut feeling, since you are one of the people closest to the story?
We demand to be released from the ghetto of separate-but-equal, ignored-yet-despised. Two consenting adults have the right to marry — or is this reserved only for “the faithful”?

Holmgren implied that the Rams gave preferential treatment to the Washington Redskins in the deal that sent the rights to the No. 2 overall draft pick to D.C. The Redskins will use the pick on Baylor QB Robert Griffin III. The Browns apparently wanted Griffin, too, despite all of the pre-draft posturing coming out of Cleveland about the Browns being ambivalent about RG3.

In Santa Barbara, a place of legendary affluence where fixer-uppers can cost more than $1 million, nobody knows just how many people are living illegally on four wheels.

Within hours, he counted 249 makeshift homes.

U.S. officials call it an "unprecedented collaboration" between the Haitian and U.S. governments, and the Inter-American Development Bank.

2009 Pillsbury Wine Co. Roan Red, Cochise County ($20-$22) - (63 percent Grenache, 25 percent Mourvedre, 12 percent Syrah.) This wine is shockingly light in color; I expected an American Rhone-like darkness, but it's more like a French Rhone Grenache. This is good! The aroma has sexy appeal from the American Oak resin and cedar, with juicy ripe red fruit. The taste has a balanced pepper grip while being rounded out with lush fruit. It's really all it should be. 90 points.

Valencia: When I was at Frontera Grill, the best chef I ever worked for was Tracey Vowell. She's a very tall, loud-mouthed woman from Louisiana who can command the respect unanimously of all these Mexican cooks. There's always this (grabbing) game that goes on in every kitchen, universally. Tracey was the only person who could get any one of us to stop it — her mere shadow made us all shape up and start doing our work. With her, she was an authoritative figure who also pushed you to learn.
"Centers are still looking for a location or are negotiating with local officials, which is why I have said that this is an ongoing process," Leusner said.

Not long ago Scott was able to change units almost the way hockey coaches do lines and defensive pairings. Not with the injuries, though.

Any wonder why they are needing big fourth-quarter comebacks?

I'd like something less rich and fruity  a cobbler maybe?

Both teams were playing the second night of back-to-backs, but the Cavs recovered more quickly. Of course, they did have the incentive of trying to make up for that horrible showing on Boston on Friday night. They jumped off to a 9-0 lead and were up 26-12 by the end of the first quarter.
Tim Spinner, 33, moving with vibrant salsas, inventive ceviches and duck-stuffed chiles en nogada in his wake, is now finally basking in his own light.

It's all part of an overall theme of uncertainty and regret, one that is best expressed by Kindermann's musings on his life's work, about what he views as "a peculiar irony at work in the world: what you lack will always be magnified by the people and events that constitute your life. A boy with no appreciation for food will be born into a family of cooks and live above a bakery. A woman who feels no kindness for her children will see, everywhere she goes, mothers and fathers fawning over their babies. So it was with him. He'd gravitated to a career as a summer camp director. All his life he'd been exasperated by other people's unwise longings."

The 2003-04 versions, brightened by Art Howe’s personality lighting up the room, demand a spot in the team photo. As do just about any team from 1963-67, though ’63’s 111-loss team which finished 48 games out of first place (and 15th out of ninth) merits special consideration.
Sun King's packaging is unique to Indiana -- it's the only brewery in the state canning its beers. "Our decision to can was made before we even had a name," Colt said. "Cans are a really great container for beer. If you think about it, they're like a mini-keg. Cans are lined, they cool down quicker, and they allow no light to spoil (the beer)."

The vitamin supplement Geritol, which once touted itself as a tonic for "tired blood," sponsored an array of '50s shows, including "To Tell the Truth" and "Ted Mack and the Original Amateur Hour" — which Gallen has put online. Geritol was made by J.B. Williams, later bought by Nabisco, then sold to Beecham, which eventually merged with what is now GlaxoSmithKline, whose legal department, from the looks of it, is the size of Iowa.

When Syria pulled its troops out of Lebanon in 2005, it left behind large caches of light weapons with Hezbollah and other pro-Assad militias-turned-political parties. Now some of those weapons are being stolen by members of these parties and sold to the merchants who are supplying the rebels, the same scenario that is happening between the Syrian army and the rebels.

The biggest example of Steeler bias showed through when Florida scatback and special-teams ace Chris Rainey was taken at No. 159. Rainey has talent, but his name only was whispered in the weeks leading to the draft. Why? Because of health and character concerns -- especially character concerns. All of the drawbacks vanished when the Steelers came calling. Rainey instantly became a multi-talented weapon who automatically will "fall in line."
A local chef said the letter grading is "a very good idea."

Andrew Luck, Stanford, 6-4, 234: Luck is a complete prospect with experience, a history of production, a feel for the game, size, athleticism, top intangibles and toughness. He doesn't have an arm like John Elway's, but it's good enough — similar to Manning's, and he throws as accurately. His movement skills are similar to Jay Cutler's and he can throw on the run. He can take a hit like Cutler. Luck has shown he can work through his progressions and find second and third options. He has produced for four years and is considered NFL-ready. There is very little chance Luck will be a bust, and an excellent chance he will be a Pro Bowl caliber player.

"Rick has paid his price for past violations," Koenig said. "And I think the number of violations people are throwing around are gross misrepresentations of the situation.

"If they do reject it, which I don't think they will and am hopeful they won't, then the project will be in jeopardy," Kafoury said. "The project is a $290 million project. We'll be $42 million short, so I don't know how that project will be able to move forward."

There are, of course, more films planned, but so far, the movie franchise doesn’t deliver the fantastic imagery and moral parables of the “Harry Potter” series (or even the sexual power and cultural subtext of the “Twilight” saga). Director Gary Ross is visually impoverished and the too-blatant overemphasis on satirizing reality TV only distracts from the book’s other, far more interesting themes.

I'm about to sound like an old man yelling at a group of kids to get off my lawn, but flag thrown on Rice today was one of the most ridiculous flags I've seen in a long time. And I would say that just as quickly if it happened to Larry Fitzgerald. In fact, I have no real problem with the unsportsmanlike penalty called on Bernard Pollard. But what Rice was flagged for was absurd.

Guy said he wanted me to take the way that I work with movement and space and work with Cirque performers to create something completely different.

But an opinion that in theory is eminently just threatens to result in a manifest injustice in Baltimore. At first blush, the high court's ruling appears to bolster the case of former Baltimore Catholic school teacher John J. Merzbacher, who was sentenced to four life terms on six counts of child rape and sexual abuse and faced 100 other charges for similar crimes. He destroyed dozens of lives, and despite his age (70) and years in prison, his victims still fear for themselves, their children and for the community. But a federal judge agreed last year with his contention that he was never informed of a plea offer, and that echoes the circumstances of one of the cases the Supreme Court addressed this week. For what he has done, Mr. Merzbacher deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison. Fortunately, the court ruling leaves open several avenues for Maryland officials to make sure he does.

"But the biggest change, agriculturally, in my time, has been from apples to grapes." With that, Handley observes, came "the dot-comers, the rise in property values and people coming up here to live with expectations of less ruralness.

Yet despite what change has brought to the valley, from this perch in the sky, looking at those vines stitched across the hills, you can't imagine that this land was ever meant for anything else.

Little Bits escalated from wearing his underwear backward to wanting to wear all clothing backward. Now, wearing underwear backward isn't that big of a deal (except that he is always picking his ill-fitting under garments out his rear) but when he wants to wear his pants or shirt the wrong way round, we start to have problems. I had to sit him down and tell him a few things, "First of all, jeans are not made to be worn that way, and it's hard to walk with the zipper in the crack of your butt. Second, when you dress up that way, people give your parents very strange looks and your parents have to spend a lot of time explaining things to random nosy people at the store. Things like, 'No, I am not punishing my child with public humiliation' and 'Because he wants it that way!' and that gets old. And thirdly, haven't you noticed that it's hard to go to the potty when you wear you pants like that?"
I find it rather interesting that universities have been built upon a foundation for solving problems with innovative solutions, but in this case, they are simply doing business as usual. In today's business world, doing business as usual means one is headed toward bankruptcy.

The repeal of "numerous taxpayer giveaways" would save more than $17 billion over the next five years, according to the senator.
The lack of consensus among Messrs. O'Malley, Miller and Busch after this morning's meeting, the trio's first face-to-face-to-face since the morning after the session adjourned in chaos, is neither surprising nor particularly dispiriting. It will take time for the ill will and recriminations that followed the session to fade, and the two legislative leaders will need to feel out their caucuses to see where they stand. After taking a beating in their districts, senators and delegates may be much more eager to come together than they were two weeks ago. The public is angry that the governor and legislators didn't do their jobs during the 90-day regular session, and the only way to calm them is to come back in a special session and do the people's business quickly and efficiently. Today's meeting didn't end in a deal, but it at least suggested a path forward.

Well, under questioning by Trung attorney Steve Baric, Registrar Neal Kelley said one of the steps in the "original" system of voting is that a voter with an electronic ballot must look at a printed version of his vote and confirm it is accurate before making the selection final by electronic means. Kelley also said that during the actual election, a manual audit was ongoing to ensure accuracy. Neither step was taken in the recount. Under questioning by Deputy County Counsel Leon Page, however, Kelley stood by results that currently have Janetwinning by seven votes. Tests of the electronic system showed it to be 100 percent accurate and every ballot that was counted on Election Day was counted during the recount, he said. Baric will argue that in a literal reading of the law, the recount was not done by "original" means.

Marriage between a man and a woman has its origins firmly grounded in the objective reality of human nature. Our human reason informs us that man and woman are made for each other.

The twist comes when the men in their lives discover their secret reading and study the book themselves. Now the men know the women's game plan.

Louis Vuitton set up shop on the rue Neuve des Capucines in 1854, describing himself as a "packager," with the tagline "Specialty in the Packing of Fashions." In 1896, George Vuitton, Louis' son, created the LV logo and monogram by which the company is now globally identified. Pamela Golbin, curator of the Les Arts Décoratifs exhibition (www.lesartsdecoratifs.fr; until Sept. 16), draws a comparison between Jacobs and Charles Frederick Worth, who, as the world's first couturier, created and established a whole new way of dressing for the emerging bourgeoisie. "Two innovators, both rooted in their respective centuries, advanced an entire industry," she says. "Two creators each in his own language appropriated cultural codes and trends in order to shape the history of contemporary fashion." This, in turn, informed Vuitton's methods and insured his success in creating luggage for this new customer, who could need as many as 10 trunks to transport everything from nightwear to evening gowns and shooting kit.

Both of those national surveys, as well as polls done by other organizations, reflect a sharp jump in recent years in support for same-sex marriage. In 2004, for example, Pew found Americans opposed gay marriage by a nearly 2-1 margin. Such a large and sudden shift in public opinion on a fundamental issue of social policy is extremely rare and reflects two trends that have overlapped -- younger Americans are far more supportive of same-sex marriage than their elders, and middle-aged Americans have shifted their views.

In November, the Post-Dispatch reported that Hull was interested in becoming an investor with Stillman's group. But sources said the situation has developed into a managerial role, in which Hull would work with Davidson and Armstrong.

Kevin Rogers of the Arizona Farm Bureau put it this way: "My industry and others need legal access to labor pools that are seasonal, short- and long-term. These pools will not be sourced from this country. This is an essential fact. You can tell me to pay more, to use convicts, to hire more students, and you can tell me technology will solve my problems. ... You can presume to tell me my business. ... It won't change the essential fact of a need for immigrant labor in Arizona and the rest of the country."

Women's issues, especially the recent debate over birth-control coverage by health insurance, play a disproportionate role in the northern part of the state, with its bustling suburbs. The rural economy, social issues and military policy are a problem for Obama in the more traditionally conservative parts of Virginia, such as the southeast, in places like Hampton Roads, where Romney campaigned this week.
Credentials in hand, I soon thereafter checked in for The Heart Truth Red Dress fashion show. I go to the show for kicks, not the fashions.

The problem isn't just about the production of weapons and war machines. It's also about their sales. As they brace for some Pentagon cuts, U.S. military contractors hope to cover their losses by selling overseas, reinforcing the U.S. position as the world's No. 1 arms exporter. Just like Philip Morris, arms merchants are merchants of death. If they don't die in conflicts sustained by U.S. weapons, the victims die from inadequate health care, lack of food and potable water, unregulated environmental pollution, and all the other problems their governments should have been addressing instead of buying weapons.

While I have not been enamored with President Obama’s performance, the Republican presidential primaries have reaffirmed that he is a superior alternative to any of the Republican candidates. Gingrich, Santorum, Romney and Paul would, no doubt, see my position on expanding the safety net in the short run, to assist those who are unable to find work because of the economic downturn, and my call for reducing income inequality, as evidence that I favor turning America into a “European-style welfare state ... that would poison the very spirit of America,” as Mitt Romney has said about Obama’s efforts.

A resident gave us a note from his doctor stating that he needed a service animal to help with his disability. We agreed that he was entitled to a companion animal, but now he has a very large, very aggressive German Shepard living in his unit.

At the last TriMet board meeting, it was estimated that charging bus riders in Fareless Square, as the agency is proposing, will raise only about $800,000 per year in revenue. Is TriMet really trying to convince Portlanders that it can't find $800,000 somewhere else in its massive annual budget?

That curious title? Country-pop singer David Nail means music itself; he alludes to its hallucinatory properties and its ability to capture our aspirations and fears.

Yet there’s nothing particularly spectral or whimsical about Nail’s sound.

I like where NetZero is going with this idea. High-speed USB sticks and portable hot spots have been around for years, eliminating the need to hunt for good Wi-Fi or to stay in one place with a fast connection.

Bin Laden had mastered both. In a sense, he put on a show, one that enjoyed a regrettably long run before the SEALs closed it for good.

The truth is, this GOP field has nothing. It’s a clown car wobbling down the road. For a while, it seemed, a new front-runner popped out every month or so to the surprise and delight of the audience.

The thing is, Ichiro Suzuki might be the most underappreciated great player of his generation. Part of this is he’s been stuck on a losing team most of his career. Part of this is because he’s Japanese; on our field of dreams, we prefer homegrown athletic superstars. Part of this is he’s playing in the Pacific Northwest; many Americans couldn’t locate the Pacific Northwest on a U.S. map, and most Mariners games end about the time Carson Daly is interviewing some indie actress I’ve never heard of.

By the time food executives sensed culpability for the obesity epidemic, it was too late. Changing French fry oil at a large restaurant chain can have such a huge financial and taste impact that corporate buyers can't risk profit margins for hard-to-measure health benefits. In another example, a Nestle executive explains that changing some of the ingredients in the ever-profitable Nestle Crunch bar could drive up the cost and cause a marketing nightmare.
Eurama cautions her against prizing the fabric over the person, a lesson that doesn't quite land, even when McKinley is swept into mourning at an indigo-tinged funeral when Eurama's husband dies. After this, McKinley continues to collect in weighty encounters successive fabrics, traveling along roads and through outposts that she notes were built for imperial extraction. McKinley's description of indigo's history, which often arises as overly deliberate exposition, is best when it appears like this, as it is — underfoot, in the air. Her most difficult procurement comes in the middle of an attempted coup in the Ivory Coast, where she sees herself mirrored in an upper-class African woman carrying, amid chaos over control of wealth, a Chanel purse: "I'm just like her; I'm unable to give up the ghost of the things I hope will fill me with meaning."

Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote to the ATF in January about allegations that Fast and Furious weapons had been "used" to kill Terry.

Then I add in the Golden Globes (knowing they’re a joke, but realizing all the Hollywood hype they create) and the awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (because the industry is so full of, and intimidated by, British talent). I also look at the prizes given out by the industry’s three big professional groups — the Screen Actors Guild, the Writers Guild and the Producers Guild.

"Governor Christie had the chance last year to adopt the Democratic plan to fully fund school aid and help suburban and rural taxpayers, " he said, "but he put tax cuts for millionaires over middle-class property tax relief.

On Wednesday, Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad condemned the French attacks and dismissed any attempt to link the crimes to the cause of Palestinian statehood. "It is time for those criminals to stop exploiting the name of Palestine through their terrorist actions or claim victory to the rights of Palestinian children, who only seek a decent life for themselves and all children of the world," Fayyad said.

As proteins slip over to a supporting role, Lightner plans to highlight not just seasonal vegetables but also a bounty of botanicals -- running the life cycle from seeds to shoots, leaves to blossoms. Instead of the more familiar appetizer/entree/side order structure, expect a single list of 15 or so moderately sized plates fully composed with side components, around $10-$25 each, plus a half-dozen desserts.
Meanwhile in Washington, the just-passed liquor law there privatizing liquor sales and ending the state's liquor monopoly is being challenged. Get this: Desperate to get their way and unable to successfully fight the merits of privatization with scare tactics, the initiative's opponents are saying the law voters approved in November violates the single-subject rule for legislative bills and ballot initiatives under the Washington Constitution. The state's constitution says no bill "shall embrace more than one subject, and that shall be expressed in the title."
Hall, the HHS official, said politics are not playing any role in the department's decisionmaking. He noted that in 2005 CDC's advisory committee issued a statement concluding there was insufficient evidence at that time to lower the blood-lead level of concern.

That could mean gambling on more costly projects. The water authority recently decided to spend about $400,000 analyzing a concept that was last assessed a decade ago: delivering water from Imperial irrigators to San Vicente Reservoir near Lakeside. The idea is to bypass Metropolitan's pipes for part of the local supply, though San Diego still would rely on MWD to make deliveries from other sources.

Shortly following that I would eliminate Sprint Lounge Social Media Correspondent Christina Milan, whose role as a pointless on-the-spot interviewer has become even more pointedly pointless now that she's interviewing every contestant's camera-shy offspring. She actually asked Tony Lucca's toddler daughter who she was voting for? Unless we all scream for ice cream gets polled, this poor child is not qualified to vote for anything. Is there no dunderheaded question that Milan is unwilling to ask? No, I say to you.

While it's true that the T-shirt has given the aloha shirt a run for its money every day of the week, visitors to Hawaii might not be as aware of the change in local custom, thanks to the alohawear uniforms favored by hotels, restaurants, bands and even the bus company. But it's enough of a concern that Honolulu designer Amos Kotomori and Hawaii fashion blogger Paula Rath independently came up with two different Wear Aloha campaigns, which also promote donning any island designer's clothing, jewelry or accessories.

The changes, part of a broader Wesson reorganization of lawmaker assignments, could make it easier for Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, a close Wesson ally, to get some of his spending proposals passed.

Not that there's any real harm in "Valentine's Day." In fact, there's nothing remotely real in it at all, and certainly no surprise. (If you don't see the "twist" coming in the Julia Roberts/Bradley Cooper seatmates-on-a-plane story, you've already fallen asleep). And the jokes? At a $10 ticket price, they average out to $5 a piece.

The back story: Prana has been so consistently popular that it's hard to remember it was a restaurant, La Mezzanine, until 2001. Today it's Ybor City's only five-story nightclub. The first two floors (and the roof) are hip-hop and reggae; the third floor is Prana's "Sanctuary," a dark, chilled-out VIP lounge with an aquarium and more private bar; the fourth floor is a packed, sweaty dance hall. "Our fourth floor is by far, on any given night, our most popular floor," said general manager Chris Whitaker. "That's where we have our huge light show, laser show, our biggest soundsystem. That's our biggest wide-open dance floor, and we have go-go dancers on two elevated platforms."

Lumet's basic problem was that he thought the upper rack was mainly for cups and glasses and that the lower rack was for plates and bowls.

Fat chance for a show that's so desperate to prevent viewers from clicking away that it fires a blitzkrieg of name-brand talent in the first 20 minutes, parachuting Green Day into a lineup of musical acts that went by like some kind of "Saturday Night Live" parody.

There are several extended segments where the piano plays solo, and that allows you a certain degree of freedom."

Still, is seems that migrants may not need Homeland Security to tell them just how dangerous it is out there. The path to the U.S. border is fraught with violence. Last year, more than 100 corpses were uncovered in mass graves in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. Many of the victims were believed to be Central American migrants headed north.

The Silver Dollar: If you want straight whiskey in the new Louisville, this is the place. Dozens of whiskeys (and tequilas) line the shelves behind the bar, and they arrive both in an ambitious cocktail list and on their own. Silver Dollar fashions itself a modern honky-tonk, featuring a large American flag across a brick wall (likely more for the motif than patriotism), country music spinning from a turntable and barbecue in the kitchen. It attracts a young and boisterous crowd. Think of it as Meat's fun younger brother. 1761 Frankfort Ave., 502-259-9540; http://www.whiskeybythedrink.com

muckduck: The Ducks can now begin their dominance as an official ELITE team with that 2012 Rose Bowl win and DAT is going to be a HUGE part of this unreal offense next year!!! Samurai7: Besides the two long runs for touchdowns untouched, DAT picked up a key first down beating a defender well short of the first down marker, which set up the winning touchdown. Also, He and Barner were the "gunners" on the punt with 22 seconds left going downfield making the fair catch necessary and creating a long field! hermtownhomy: DAT definitely stood out, but that does not mean he should be singled out as the only reason they won. He is scary fast. Probably the fastest player in football right now and we all look forward to the future with him, but his two runs were not necessarily turning points in the game. They still could have gone on to score if those two runs hadn't happened. True turning points in the game were the interception and fumble recovery. I just don't agree with JC's point here that DAT was the reason they won. It was a team effort. RipCityDroHead85: De'Ant was prolly the MVP, I'd agree, but LaMike and Darren had pretty good games too, along with Tuinei. As far as that best duck ever, I don't know if i'd be heaping that much praise on him just yet, LaMike made a key block that sprung one of his long ones. No mention of the best duck rb ever out there blocking for another rb. portlandchiro1: I agree with the praise heaped on De'Anthony, but lets not get carried away. This was a full team win with many stars contributing. Where would Oregon have been without the two forced turnovers from the defense-including the unbelievable interception by Kiko Alonzo? How about the catches by Tunei, the grueling runs by LaMichael James, the touchdown catch by Barner, and on and on on. This was a team win and there are many heroes. Bravo to all the Ducks!!! What was your favorite moment from the Rose Bowl? What about next season are you most excited for? Post your thoughts below.

The problems started with an unusual accumulation of ice crystals in the airplane's three pitot tubes, probes that measure speed by capturing the pressure of the oncoming air. Losing reliable airspeed information, the autopilot turned the airplane over to its human minders, as it was designed to do. For some reason -- perhaps he thought the speed was too high -- the pilot who was flying the airplane pulled it up into a climb, rapidly gaining several thousand feet. This in turn led to an aggravated stall.

A SteriPen water purifier has long been a must-have on multi-day river trips and desert hikes, but my one complaint has been the batteries — if you're at all environmentally conscious, the idea of tossing out those four lithium AAs, even as long as they last, can be tougher to stomach than a glassful of protozoan cysts.

Our endorsement comes after discussions with city officials and finance experts who assured us this was no back-door scheme to privatize city assets. They also convinced us that many potential trust deals - such as retrofitting buildings to be more energy efficient - probably couldn't be done with traditional public financing. In many instances, the city still will use traditional municipal bonds, but privately financed deals open up a new world of capital. Though they potentially feature higher interest rates, they bring efficiencies and better allocation of risk that could drive down costs.

Unfortunately, in 34 states, 75% of the insurance market is controlled by five or fewer companies. In Alabama, almost 90% is controlled by just one company. Without competition, the price of insurance goes up and the quality goes down. And it makes it easier for insurance companies to treat their customers badly - by cherry-picking the healthiest individuals and trying to drop the sickest; by overcharging small businesses who have no leverage; and by jacking up rates.

“The perception of things — it plays an incredible role,” he says. “Because sometimes the reality is quite different. In America, I have done horror movies, action films, cult films, social movies.

When you've found a nanny you love, it's important to do some official fact-checking. As you check a nanny's references, you'll want to ask challenging and specific questions. For instance, ask a reference to reveal one bad thing about their experience with the nanny. Find out how often the nanny was unable to come to work. Ask the reference if they've ever checked up on the nanny. To get a sense of a nanny's engagement level for the child she cared for, ask her reference what outings she arranged for the child and if she arranged playdates.

Though I'm a deep-fried turkey fan and couldn't find a recipe, I wasn't eager to risk disfigurement from lowering an enormous bird into a vat of boiling oil - if I could even find a big enough vat - so I nixed that idea. Short of a wild, last-ditch veer into turkey tartare territory - inspired by Ippuku's chicken tartare, which Michael Bauer quite liked on his visit last year - my mind drew a blank.

Ken Williams has the enviable position of seemingly being the only Chicago executive immune from the pressure to win and perform. In recent years we have seen all the Chicago franchises clean house. The Chairman needs to pocket his loyalty and let Williams go and bring in a new philosophy. I don't mean elevating Rick Hahn, either. There is a reason Hahn is still with the Sox. Frankly, I'm tired of hearing how wonderful is everyone in the Sox's organization. The chamber of commerce pitch delivered by those such as Hawk Harrelson and Steve Stone and others is insulting to knowledgeable fans. How many more years do Sox fans have to tolerate more of the same? How many more years does Williams get? -- Mike Major; Granger, Ind.

Whenever I get the chance to show love to a Diplomats member — whether it's a lowly alum like Un Kasa or the king of kings himself, Cam'ron — I'm going to do it. This is because the Diplomats (better known as Dipset) will go down as one of the best rap cliques of all time, a distinction that, at least for me, requires no second-guessing. It was the Dips' timeless hits, outsized personalities and the insane Harlem flair they brought to everything they did that made them rap's hottest crew for a few years. Before rappers were yelling "Swag!" every 15 seconds, the Diplomats did it without the tiresome reminding. It was just always there.

What can we do about it? Differences in genetic makeup, metabolism and even bacteria levels in the gut explain why some people gain weight and others don't. But obesity experts are quick to add that just because you've inherited a tendency to put on pounds doesn't mean you have to feed that tendency. Everyone can build lean-muscle mass through exercise, especially weight training, to boost metabolism. That will help you burn more calories even at rest. Exercise also may give brown fat a boost. Pregnant moms need to be especially mindful of excess weight gain, sugar consumption and controlling blood-sugar levels through diet and exercise so they don't pass on problems to future generations. Losing baby weight between pregnancies also would help. While Americans do their part, scientists will continue to look at ways to manipulate gut bacteria and hormone levels to help prevent weight gain — and weight regain.
The question is hardly isolated to PacifiCorp. Utilities across the country have already canceled plans to build more than 150 new coal plants in the past four years, according to the shareholder activist group As You Sow.

Partnering with Teach for America will strengthen the hiring pool for many of our highest-need schools and subjects. Moreover, the organization will help us keep homegrown leaders who decide to join Teach for America here in our great city of Cleveland. Like in the other 43 communities where the organization works, Teach for America teachers will interview alongside other candidates for open positions and, if hired, become school district employees. In my experience, school districts want to partner with Teach for America because it creates a pipeline of talented teachers and leaders eager to work in the most challenging settings.

* Children should be encouraged to intervene on behalf of the victim. When one child does so, it is likely that other children will also step forward.

By now, you are probably wondering: where is the Big Boi album? Well, it's here, sad to say. It never clicked for me, and I'm not entirely sure why. I always love Big Boi's rhyming, and some of the individual tracks are fantastic, but I find the second half of the record a real chore. I admit that I could never get into the tracks with Janelle Monae and Jamie Foxx, and they're back to back, and right after that there's the George Clinton song that I don't understand. I zone out around there and only re-engage when "Shine Blockas" comes on, and that type of thing never happened with an OutKast set. I adore them to pieces, and I will happily pay money for anything they put out, but I'm convinced now -- Andre and Antawn really do need each other.

The casting of Hugh Laurie as cranky, crippled Dr. House, endlessly irritated by patients and staff and everything but the cerebral medical mysteries he enjoyed, took the series to a different level.

Potter broke midnight records in July 2011 with $43.5 million overnight.

Faculty Council’s Demands
Mayor Bing has talked about achieving that but never acted on it. The City Council has been even more negligent over a longer period of time about providing the basics of a functioning city to Detroiters. Even Tuesday, when members were scheduled to meet about the potential loss of millions in federal money for the poor, five of nine showed up late, and one never showed at all.

It says during one week in June 2009, Singh and two other California women allegedly got more than $122,000 in fraudulent cash advances, as well as goods and services. They tried unsuccessfully to obtain tens of thousands of dollars more in fraudulent cash advances and merchandise, prosecutors say.
In keeping with the home's Cal-Arizona laid-back vibe, Sharron brought garden furniture indoors: old marble table bases are just as pretty in modern dining rooms as they were in European courtyards, she says. (It helps, of course, that her garden furniture shop is without peer.)
I also still think about the Manila clams ($17) grilled on the plancha and arranged on top of a soupy, buttery mound of heirloom beans with green beans and escarole. I'm generally not wild about clams because so many are chewy and strong, but these are pristine and perfectly complement the other elements.

93. Cincinnati (from New England), Brandon Thompson, dt, Clemson.
There were teeny tostada rounds mounded high with diced raw hamachi ringing with lime aioli, pico de Gallo and chile piquin. The meatballs glazed in ancho-cranberry barbecue sauce hid the surprise of melty Oaxaca cheese inside. Tender skewered octopus were most notable for the presentation — the octo-kebab sliced into oblong coins for maximum tentacle crisp-age. The carnitas tacos were tender from their beer, Coke and orange juice braise. Chicken enchiladas came beneath an ebony shine of my new favorite mole poblano, its mysteriously blend of 25 ingredients (from mulatto chiles to hazelnuts, figs, pepitas and tomatillos) in sharper balance than Cantina’s sweeter suburban rendition.

The ISM, a trade group of purchasing executives based in Tempe, Ariz., compiles its service sector index by surveying about 375 purchasing executives across the country.
The April 16, 2007, edition of The New Yorker contains John Colapinto's elegant dispatch on the controversy, subtitled "Has a remote Amazonian tribe upended our understanding of language?" It is, frankly, a better synopsis than Everett's book, which is burdened by awkward construction and flat explanatory prose.
Gov. Sonny Perdue is expected to be in attendance Wednesday when the state Board of Education receives a briefing from the Governor's Office of Student Achievement, a separate state agency which initially called for the cheating investigation.

"I mean it's tough seeing your best player lay on the ice," Hitchcock said. "It's tough getting the information he's not coming back. But what's tougher is the impact it has on your team. So, as a leader, both of us have found out ways to get our team to move on. Because we've had to move on."
But in dealing with the public health issue of tobacco smoke, St. Charles County lags behind the state of Illinois, which adjoins it along the Mississippi; neighboring St. Louis County; the city of St. Louis; and such forward-thinking communities as Clayton, Kirkwood, Creve Coeur and, within St. Charles County itself, Lake Saint Louis and O'Fallon.

If it weren't for the family of billionaire casino developer Sheldon Adelson contributing $21 million to Winning Our Future, the pro-Gingrich super PAC, the outside organization wouldn't have been able to launch attacks that hobbled the better-funded and organized campaign of Republican front-runner Mitt Romney.
So far, Booker’s greatest success has been garnering $43 million in matching funds to the Facebook donation, but the pitfalls surrounding private donations in schools came to light last week when it was discovered that part of a $500,000 grant from the Broad Foundation funded a proposal to "co-locate" new district and charter schools with more than a dozen current schools. The plan was obtained by The Star-Ledger and rankled parents and educators who felt they had been misled.
From the beginning, Atlanta’s strategy to build the Beltline involved building a variety of parks to stoke grassroots support before the more difficult work of installing transit lines in the form of light rail and streetcars. The Beltline has opened a skateboarding park, a Little League baseball diamond on top of a former landfill and a playground on a hill in the Historic Fourth Ward.
Guard documents also showed that Brenes was ineligible because he received a college scholarship from the Reserve Officers' Training Corps. In essence, he was reimbursed twice for his education costs  strictly prohibited by military rules.
Derek Lowe (2-1, 3.50 ERA) will try to help extend the Royals' woes with another solid outing against them. The veteran right-hander gave up three runs and scattered 11 hits over 6 2-3 innings in an 8-3 victory in Kansas City on April 13, but suffered his first loss of the season Wednesday.
In one case, Ally CEO Michael Carpenter told Romero's auditors, there was an executive at the company who was compensated $1.5 million a year, including $1 million in salary.
I thought about that when the story broke of Robert Bales, the Army staff sergeant accused of horrifically gunning down 17 civilians in Afghanistan. Bales has served under two commanders in chief without combat experience, and the vast majority of members of Congress who funded the two wars to which Bales was sent have themselves never heard a shot fired in war.

Next stop: Sidecar 11, which offers Prohibition-era-inspired cocktails. The group tried two: a whiskey sour made for the tour (tequila, lemon, sugar, egg white, soda, Regan's Orange Bitters No. 6) and Nana's Nip (Laird's Applejack, ginger purée, lemon) along with some local cheese, bread and fruit.
Natural gas tax rates would also change, and for the better for most companies. Companies that produce less than 10,000 cubic feet of natural gas per day through traditional wells would no longer pay a tax. That's good news for about 90 percent of Ohio's conventional natural gas producers.
Bolm, owner of Cedar Lake Cellars near Foristell, said that people who come to see the church once it's rebuilt will be happy. He intends to use it mainly for weddings.

Palin, a Fox News contributor and onetime local sportscaster, spent the 8 a.m. hour loosely participating in a variety of segments alongside "Today" host Ann Curry and company. The segment about advice on raising teenage daughters could have been a lot shorter if Palin just said what she was thinking: Keep them away from Levi Johnston.
Benoit Paire of France defeated Guillermo Garcia-Lopez of Spain 4-6, 7-5, 7-5.
The fund, formally known as the Open Space, Farmland and Historic Preservation Trust Fund, added the historic component just 10 years ago, McCulloch pointed out.

She would not have a baby. This was her conclusion, the choice she made. She loved her husband. She had a stepdaughter whom she adored. They were her family. But she would be biologically childless.
The parent’s attorney, Elkin Kistner, said the ruling has filled him with “profound despair.”
McCue is also part of the valley's current wave of venture-backed entrepreneurs who are much more likely to be acquired than go the Wall Street route with an IPO. Unlike the bustling 1990s, when the vast majority of start-ups with venture backing dreamed of going public, the dominant trend today is in mergers and acquisition, or M&A.
Financier T. Boone Pickens thinks natural gas makes sense. In his "Pickens Plan" television commercials he states, "natural gas is cleaner, cheaper, abundant and it's ours."
I'm from Mayfield. My wife's from Boston: Koyen Parikh Shah. We met at Yale. There began my campaign to bring her to Cleveland. She was the first Global Clevelander from my perspective. We ended up in Malaysia first, then Cleveland.

Yet, when nearly 2.2 million Californians are out of work, they face stiff competition. The unemployment rates for veterans age 20 to 24 (24.9 percent) and 25 to 34 (20.1 percent) are substantially higher than their non-veteran peers, according to state figures.
No reason to think that philosophy has changed. The Thunder won a second consecutive Northwest Division title, snagged the No. 2 seed in the West and emerged as a team capable of winning an NBA championship.
The cake layers are all-natural, not a speck of chemically treated flour in the batter. The buttercream has all real butter, and the fresh rose topper is organic and fragrant, a dazzler that comes in many colors. All of this is what you expect from a natural foods purveyor, with polished elegance as a plus. We loved the moist cake but would have liked a spike of lemon in our raspberry filling and a frosting recipe without a slick mouth feel at the finish. But you try it; there are plenty of options, including whipped cream, chocolate mousse and cream cheese.
However, one of my favorite manifestations is chickpea flour. Combined with water and olive oil, it works magic in crepes and its polenta-like cousin, panisse, both of which are specialties of Provence.
Queen Creek got a big boost when the Town Council approved construction of a large medical office building, paving the way for for what it hopes will be an influx of medical jobs.

Epstein is the boy wonder who was brought in from Boston to remake the Cubs. Like many longtime fans, I view him with suspicion. What does he really know about us? Just because the team has not won a World Series in a few years does not mean it lacks tradition.
Wolff sees no reason why spinning couldn't be applied to continuing education for other disciplines, such as medicine. But he has no plans to expand to other forms of exercise.
Fox's pictures were what you would expect in this day and age of 40-plus HD cameras and super slow motion. The network stayed away from most fan shots (hopefully ESPN took notice), replayed most penalties quickly, and was all over the biggest plays with multiple angles. There were a couple of times I didn't see a replay I wanted, but that happened far fewer times than it does during the regular season. One negative was Pam Oliver saying Donald Driver was questionable to return to the game when a picture showed him wearing a walking boot.
"We hear it," Frisch replied.
Well, as you know, big Jim did get into this extra-inning classic. When he came to bat in the bottom of the 12th inning, we just looked at each other as if to say, this is it, the moment we had been waiting for.

"We’re watching it … really rejuvenate itself," she said from the Turtle Brook Inn along Northfield Avenue.
Ohio State started on the edge between crisp and rushed, not the first time the Buckeyes have sought offensive rhythm through sharp, quick passes in the first five minutes. The result was a 13-3 lead that saw the Buckeyes shooting 6-for-10 in the first five minutes while Purdue was 1-for-10.
She said the family knows Lane as "a son, brother, nephew, cousin and grandson." She added: "While we are devastated by his acts, we offer him our unconditional love."
In December, you may recall, Occupy Denver was also ejected from Civic Center west of Broadway, although not before they managed to deface stone balustrades and commit other acts of vandalism. But some diehards never really left. They camped on the sidewalk along Broadway for the entire winter, often obstructing passage in clear defiance of the law.
Offered an opportunity to speak at Wednesday's sentencing, Powell criticized the judge's conduct of the trial, alleging "a lot of racism." He said the "man who killed (Delarrian) is still running around in the street."
The announcement was the first by a sitting president, and Obama's Republican rival, Mitt Romney, swiftly disagreed with it. "I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman," Romney said from Oklahoma.
With De Smet outside hitter Drew Steiner struggling a bit in the first game, Blake Kribs stepped up with a solid effort. He had five kills in the first game and finished with a match-high 10 to go along with eight digs.
Robyn Celia runs Pappy & Harriet's saloon and restaurant 53 miles away from the festival in Pioneertown. The desert denizens, she said, take a curious rather than defensive approach to Coachella revelers. "They've never been anything but welcoming to the out-of-towners. They get a kick out of it. I think the locals think it's hilarious. It's not something they're going to see at Applebee's."

A breakdown in talks would be an opportune time to send we-mean-business signals to Iran. Obama might take up the Senate GOP leadership's offer to help write a resolution authorizing military action. He might order pouring more oil into the strategic reserve to cushion the economy from the fallout of hostilities. He might propose a 1 percent income surtax to be levied in the event of war to pay its costs. No doubt there are people in the administration with other or better ideas.

But dreaming big, McCue says, is precisely why Mountain View-based Tellme became a Microsoft subsidiary in May for an undisclosed price some reports put at $800 million to $1 billion.

Hard to believe, spring training is already here. You know what that means, right? Only a few more weeks until the NFL draft. … My synopsis of the baseball season: (1) Pitchers and catchers report, (2) Spring training games commence, (3) Opening Day, (4) Pirates mathematically eliminated. … Did you see where Cheat, er, Chad Knaus, Jimmie Johnson's perennially rule-breaking crew chief, has been suspended and fined yet again by NASCAR? My question: When are drivers like Johnson going to start getting suspended for employing underhanded cheaters?

Just lends credence to what I've always contended: Baseball - the only sport where you can play 162 games and gain weight.

But I don't think a single trade at the March 15 deadline, or the sudden willingness of the Blazers to play hard and scratch their way into the No. 8 seed in the Western Conference, will fix a thing.

I've been testing Calltrunk, a service that records, stores and transcribes calls initiated by its app or website; a manual feature on iPhones and Skype also enables recording incoming calls. It uses landlines, mobile phones or Skype accounts to place calls, and these calls are stored in a password-protected account for $5 to $50 monthly. I also tested Uppidy, a free service that, once installed on an Android phone or BlackBerry, automatically logs all text messages sent to or from that phone in a Web-based account for reading or sorting later.

It's hard to imagine that bad blood has lasted 50 years, but maybe there's something to Sullinger's theory.

Indeed, Prince seems to covet the freedom afforded to jazz musicians who reinterpret their material nightly. His choice of support acts was telling: talented jazz bassist Esperanza Spalding and jazz-soul singer Hathaway. There was some head-scratching among fans when these names were announced, but Prince was sending a message -- come to the concert expecting stunning musicianship and something not unlike a jazz performance, and you won't be disappointed. And as strange as it was to hear scat singing in an arena, Spalding's too-brief set was a thrill. The bassist's four-piece jazz act simmered straight through their show, and Spalding's own songwriting was ambitious. Hathaway's set was sleepier, but had its exciting moments -- like her cover of Luther Vandross' "Forever, For Always, For Love," which climaxed in a guitar solo.

Tynes did dream it, and that’s why he wanted that chance. As much as a touchdown would’ve made things easier for the Giants after Devin Thomas covered a fumble to give the Giants the ball at the 49ers’ 24-yard line, Tynes was hoping for a field-goal attempt.
With our appetites whetted by simple appetizers of mushrooms stuffed with prosciutto, Belgian endive and salmon roe, and toasts of roasted pepper and Italian tuna, we sit down to a first-course of crab bisque, the result of a long and loving reduction in which a single Dungeness crab is cooked to its essence, then elevated with cream.

How might you know that Canadian folk-rocker Roxanne Potvin used to be a blues singer? Perhaps you can tell by how well she’s able to make effective, compelling music from the most rudimentary materials. Many of the songs on “Play” are little more than a simple, repetitive melody sung in Potvin’s modest voice, some sandpaper guitar and a straightforward drumbeat. The French-language “Dis-Moi Que Tu M’Aimes” is little more than a shout, a swirling Farfisa riff and a few well-timed halts by the rhythm section; somehow, it’s irresistible. “Pretty Girls” repeats its title over and over like a drawled mantra — it’s more hypnotic Velvet Underground than modern pop. “Let Me Go” is little more than a blurt, but it’s certainly an arresting one. Potvin keeps things punchy by getting in and out of her songs quickly — several tracks on “Play” barely break the two-minute mark. It’s all such fun that by the time she drops her languid cover of Right Said Fred’s “I’m Too Sexy” on you at the conclusion of the album, you’ll barely mind. Fans of Liz Phair’s early insouciance and Lucinda Williams’ occasional whimsy should search this out.
Why it's hot: The weekly "Pulp the Party" helped spark a renaissance for subculture dance nights in Ybor City and beyond. No need to peacock here, folks; just let your freak flag fly. "It's about blowing off steam and not having to pop your collars or putting on a jacket," said mastermind Paul Geller, a.k.a. DJ Pauly Crush, of Orlando. "We take pride in delivering music that isn't being played at other clubs yet, or maybe ever will — certainly not on the radio." That means maintaining a core group of like-minded DJs with similar musical tastes; Geller even grooms new up-and-coming DJs to fill in. Pulp also brings quality drink specials, like a free keg of Stella Artois, $1 and $2 vodka drinks and free vodka shots when a snow machine goes off twice an hour. For Pulp's third anniversary party in July, they offered free drinks from 9 p.m. to midnight, and there was a line around the block to get in.

The underlying goal of SB 1070 is "attrition through enforcement" — making undocumented immigrants feel unwelcome in Arizona and making their day-to-day lives so difficult that they move on. Gov. Jan Brewer argues that this can be done without abuse or racial profiling of Latinos. But similar efforts undertaken by Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio have produced alarming results. Arpaio used the power of his office to stop Latino drivers disproportionately and to initiate immigration sweeps in neighborhoods not in response to reports of crime but rather to complaints that people with dark skin were present. The U.S. Department of Justice concluded that such tactics resulted in "unconstitutional policing" and routinely violated the rights of Latinos, including U.S. citizens and legal residents.
St. Louis was denied a sweep in its series with the Pittsburgh Pirates on Thursday, as it dropped a 6-3 decision at Busch Stadium. Allen Craig drove in two runs and David Freese added a run-scoring double for the Cardinals, who lost for just the second time in their last seven.

This coffee table book — released just in time for Tuesday's home opener marking the 50th anniversary of Dodger Stadium, is divided into nine chapters — you expected a different number in a baseball book? — and range from the early Brooklyn years to the Dodgers' recent move of their spring training home from Vero Beach, Fla., to Arizona. There are two chapters on Brooklyn, including an essay by Roger Kahn (author of "The Boys of Summer") and seven on the Dodgers in Los Angeles, mostly divided by decades.
Diagnostic tests available include pH monitoring either with a catheter down the nose or with an innovative wireless device placed in the esophagus. In select cases, special X-ray studies using a dye to illustrate the anatomy or plumbing of the upper tract may be beneficial. We also may perform an upper endoscopy exam to visualize the tissue and, if needed, take biopsies to further define the cause and extent of disease. Biopsies are especially useful in patients with an allergic predisposition such as asthma, allergies, eczema or a family history of gastro-esophageal reflux disease.
In the third quarter of last year, Wal-Mart reversed a string of quarterly sales declines at stores open at least a year -- an indicator of a retailer's health.

The priest knows something of dissent. Of Jewish heritage, he had to fight to become an Orthodox priest in the 1970s and was suspended for almost two years in the '80s for "politically motivated dissent," until a visiting President Reagan met with him in Moscow and the Kremlin decided it was too scandalous for the priest to stay out of service.

Mr. Putin's day of reckoning, his choice of an end game, may be years away, considering his many strengths. He has reasserted state control over much of Russia's oil wealth and has a loyal power base in the security services.

--Speaking of changing recipes, PepsiCo says it knows how to sell more Tropicana brand orange juice: Add water. Some consumers prefer orange juice that’s less thick. Others want juice with the "goodness" of oranges and fewer calories, the company says. It believes consumers will pay the same -- or more -- for such versions. PepsiCo’s Tropicana, the best-selling OJ in the U.S., is trying to regain space in refrigerators after a repackaging fiasco three years ago hurt the brand and allowed Coca-Cola to outflank it. The brand lost market share last year to Coke’s Minute Maid and Simply Orange brands. So now PepsiCo is focusing on products with less juice, more innovation and, therefore, higher profit margins.

Going into play on the last day of the season, Reyes was batting .336 and Braun was batting .335. Reyes got a bunt single in his first at bat and then promptly took himself out of the game, finishing the season with a .337 batting average. That meant that Braun would have to go 3 for 3 or at a minimum 3 for 4 in order to catch Reyes. Braun ended up going 0-4 and ending with a .332 average. There were some who criticized the shortstop, while others defended him. I suppose if you are a baseball fan, you could make an argument either way.

One man who'd had difficulty getting a raise from his last employer was thinking of self-employment because there would be "no limit on income." A dislocated worker attending trade school wanted to open his own windshield repair shop to "start at the top, not the bottom, this time." A single mother said she wanted to work at home because she was tired of worrying about childcare. Other reasons the group gave for favoring self-employment included the desire to be their own boss, setting their own hours, increased security, the possibility for retirement income and the freedom that comes from running your own show.

Pujols' lead agent, Dan Lozano, visited camp last week without engaging the club in negotiations over an extension. Pujols has asked the club to refrain from commenting on the matter but insisted he believes an agreement is possible. "If we start talking all it takes is 24 hours to reach an agreement. I don't think it takes a month or two months or a year," said Pujols, who is under contract through 2011 but enjoys veto power over any deal following the 2010 season. "When you start talking it can two or three days and that's it, you get it done. If they make an offer and I'm pleased with the offer we'll get it done."

Let me give you an example of a case in which I think the IRS really blew it. We reported a Baptist church in northern Arkansas back in 2004 where the pastor has held a service on Independence Day. Part of the church's service even included registering voters registration (no problem with that). However, the pastor gave a sermon while flanked by two large screens. As he would start talking about an issue, photographs of George W. Bush or Sen. John Kerry would be flashed on the screen. When he said "one candidate" is fighting terrorists, a very nice official White House photo of Bush was shown; he'd then note in a mocking tone that "the other candidate believes we are not at war at all but in a lawsuit." An unflattering picture of Kerry in a crowd was shown. It went on like this for several issues. Bush was praised and Kerry was belittled.

One of the most amazing traits of the amazing Rivera is his durability in a job that tends to eat its young both physically and mentally. Since last appearing on the DL, Rivera had appeared in 595 games and registered 360 saves (with a 1.89 ERA in that span). If you want a feel how long a stretch 595 games without the DL is, it represents roughly the entire career of Brad Lidge, who appeared in his 593rd game on Opening Day as Storen’s replacement and recorded his 224th career save.
It's a job that, so far this year, has included an investigation into a student's brutal off-campus beating. There was the boy who brought a pocketful of prescription pills to sell  even though they were non-narcotic drugs aimed at managing schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There was the call from a substitute teacher who reported a dice game in progress  on a science lab table. And there was a wall full of gang graffiti in a bathroom, which could have been the work of a real gang or maybe just some wannabes.

What a Pena Nieto presidency would look like, however, remains unclear. The fresh-faced, 45-year-old former governor is promising national rejuvenation after six years of a grueling drug war and sluggish economic growth, but his dozens of campaign pledges center on more mundane matters — small-scale infrastructure projects such as highway overpasses and better flood control.
"Everybody says, 'How is Kurt doing?' I say, 'Kurt is doing fine. I'm not doing so well,' " Finch said. "I've wrecked a lot of cars and haven't been able to secure some sponsorship yet that we desperately need. Other than that, Kurt is doing a great job."

It is illegal to use state campaign funds, regulated under Ohio law, for a federal campaign, regulated under federal law. Simply put, if you want to run for Ohio dog catcher (a fictional post), you must follow Ohio law, and if you then decide to run for Congress -- or even just want to consider such a run -- you must file paperwork with the FEC, start a federal account and steer clear of mingling the money you raised running for dog catcher. The law keeps candidates from doing an end-run around federal campaign funding restrictions.

The wine is a deliciously rich, flavorful rosé with an alcohol level of 14 percent and a surprising amount of depth and body. It's made by bleeding lightly colored juice from the skins of fermenting old-vine malbec grapes. This is a rosé for red wine drinkers, rather than a lightweight, strawberry-flavored aperitif. Although it's dry, it isn't bone dry, and it has flavors of zesty cranberries laced with spice. Best served with food, the Crios Rosé of Malbec is a versatile wine that would be great with turkey and cranberry sauce, grilled chicken or even spicy Asian dishes.
On the morning of June 20, 1937, a three-man Russian crew made the first-ever nonstop flight from Moscow to the United States, passing over the North Pole and landing at Pearson Field in 63 hours. The plane was California-bound, but after flying through sub-zero temperatures, thickening ice on the plane’s wings and plummeting oil pressure forced them to land at the Vancouver airbase. The plane had traveled more than 5,000 miles and landed with 11 gallons of fuel left.

For nearly 20 years, far more NFL stadiums have been built in urban than suburban settings. In that period, 16 of 21 NFL stadiums were built in central cities, 11 of them in downtown districts.
"Not very sexy stuff, but it certainly made you do your homework if you were going to communicate the message," Brodie says. "I didn't start with resorts or a car dealership where I could easily grasp the concept. I started with retaining walls and sound barriers and learned all about load-bearing reinforcing strips so it was a little bit different than I envisioned, but it was also really gratifying because I really got to learn about some really cool things."

Twinsburg Mayor Katherine Procop said that during conference calls last week, the company's chief executive and several administration officials talked about bright futures for Chrysler cities.
2010 Starmont Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc ($18, 13.9%): This offshoot of Merryvale reaches up and down the length of the valley for fruit to balance out the flavors in this larger-production bottling. Fermented in a mix of mostly older oak and steel, it comes out a touch edgy and tart. But the cat's-business scents are a shout-out to New Zealand fans, backed up by pretty snap pea and tart peach. Zesty and fulfilling.
The activities kick off May 27 with a festival celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Golden Gate Bridge. The bash, which culminates with a fireworks show, will be held along the 4-mile stretch from Fort Point to Pier 39. Because the event is free, officials say there is no way to gauge how many people might attend. Mary Currie, a bridge spokeswoman, said the expectation is that thousands will participate from all over the country. But the hope is that because the waterfront is spread out, there will be some breathing room.
Even with higher fares, A4A notes that airlines are holding on to less than 1 penny in profit for every dollar in revenue. That's because operating expenses, mostly due to higher fuel prices, are climbing just as fast as sales.
Yet there is much to like about the idea of such a bill, which would grant consumers the right to understand and control the use of their personal information by companies with access to it. Consumers today have little recourse when online companies package and sell their personal information for uses the consumers never contemplated, and rarely even know when it happens.
-- Raul Ibanez started out as a catcher, so he's the emergency backstop in case something freaky happens to both Stewart and Martin. I'd imagine that both Stewart and Martin would have to get hit by a bus before first pitch for the 39-year-old Ibanez to put the gear on. But it was worth asking the manager, since both catchers are in the starting lineup.
Woods and others nevertheless advised gays and lesbians in the military to be cautious about disclosing their sexual orientation in the near future, because the administration could ask the Supreme Court to reinstate the law.
Bottom line: New Yorkers should step up to save mass transit. Mostly, we should be willing to foot the tab for any worker perks or pay hikes we won't actively oppose. (Public support for the transit union during its crippling, illegal 2005 Christmas strike suggests New Yorkers may be reluctant to speak out against labor concessions, even now. Fine -- so let them put their money where their mouths aren't.)
"To one of the major airlines at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, for whom I work: We are so short-staffed at the ticket counter. If you think I'm giving you blood this summer, think again. You had better be prepared for delays, because I'm not going from one side of the counter to the other wearing roller skates or a skateboard. It's pathetic and it's pitiful how short-staffed we are. The only ones that lose are the public."

We in Colorado are accustomed to occasional droughts, scarcity of water, and water restraints. But several countries in sub-Saharan Africa suffer from endemic drought, and frequently face massive displacements of people as a result. There is consensus that the contributing causes of the civil war in Darfur, primarily an ethnic conflict, were drought and desertification.
Paul won't threaten Romney's hold on the GOP nomination—Romney's delegate lead is so big he is likely to reach the 1,144 delegates he needs to clinch the nomination by the end of the month.

"Project Runway All Stars": The not-too-great-but-sort-of-passable all-star edition continues, with a sportswear challenge, featuring guest judge designer Cynthia Rowley. (9 p.m., Lifetime)
This is worth writing about, even though in Jamie Moyer’s last game as an Oriole I was still single. I got married a week after Moyer last pitched for Baltimore, back in 1995, his third and final season here. That was before three kids and 16 years of wedded bliss for me.
TSA says Precheck members are selected randomly for regular screening to enhance security. But that unpredictability irks frequent travelers. The agency doesn't make travelers go to the end of the regular screening line, however, but instead slips them into the front of the regular queue.
Dinner? It's hit or miss. The steak is fair. The risotto is edible, bordering on OK. So is the sea bass (served whole) if your preference is for doing all your own seasoning at the table. The braised lamb shank may have been the best meal we had, tender and and properly seasoned, suggesting that a modicum of patience and skill is somewhere to be found in the kitchen. I just know it won't be a lasting memory, like, say, the lamb at Boulevard Bistro.
After Thursday's loss, Paul expressed his satisfaction with the franchise's dedication to winning, praising the preparation of first-year coach Monty Williams and GM Dell Demps. Paul's teammates seemed crushed after the loss, and he took that as a positive, the New Orleans Times-Picayune's Jimmy Smith reports.
The Pennsylvania Department of Health has extended the grace period by two weeks for students to comply with school immunization requirements. The new rules went into effect in August. If students don't have the required immunizations, they may not be able to attend school, the department said.

The group's anything-goes-and-usually-does approach was what first caught the ear of 15-year-old drummer Tom Ardolino, who sent a fan letter to keyboardist Terry Adams after catching one of the group's shows in Springfield, Mass. In 1974, Adams invited him to join the group when drummer Tom Staley quit.
But now that Hall of Fame business will be tough sledding. As the central character in the Mitchell Report and with Clemens' trainer Brian McNamee and Pettitte both providing enough evidence to confirm it, we all know he is a drug cheat and that will likely keep him, Bonds, Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and all the other big names of the Steroid Era out of Cooperstown.

The film opened in Plano, Texas -- an upscale suburb of Dallas -- and did great business there, too. Falk says for the first week in Jacksonville, Fla., "we did double anything else we did that week.'' Even in Utah, where there was a brief flap when one Salt Lake City exhibitor pulled the movie, "Brokeback'' is doing very well.

The new indictment includes new evidence supporting the racketeering allegation – emails concerning Hawks basketball tickets, letters about Falcons football tickets and an invoice and check to coverPope’s legal fees. It also notes that in late 2008 Lewis said in a meeting with other school officials in his office that Reid had tried to blackmail him. He later gave her a new contract and pay raise, but denied to investigators that she had tried to blackmail him.

Brooklyn Finance Director Dennis Kennedy says that on average the city gets $250,000 a month in withholding taxes, or about $3 million a year in revenues, from American Greetings. That works out to 20 percent of the city's general fund, or 13 percent of its total annual budget of about $24 million.
Sweet meets art at Roxy restaurant, thanks to pastry chef Kristina Dula's menu of fall desserts. Like her "autumn fair fried cheesecake":
"It's difficult to say this without seeming self-involved, but really, primarily, what I care about is making people laugh. When it's my job, then I do feel pressure to perform — a professional duty. It can be exhausting. But I'm happy to be able to have quiet and intelligent conversation. In the past, I didn't have an off switch as much. But now, because I'm focused on work, and there are different kinds of dimensions to my life, I don't have that tendency."
"When you're buying stock, you're gambling. You're taking a chance," Prokop said. At 86, he's not interested in gambling with his retirement again.

The risk assessments — performed by an expert designated by a judge handling the case — would examine the likelihood that the person against whom the final restraining order is issued will commit violence against the victim or their child. But the assessments would only be ordered in certain cases, such as those in which the accused has a history of violence, threatened to kill the victim or their child, or allegedly used or threatened to use a weapon against them.
Let's zero in on what I consider the most important group: bargain hotels. As with overall bests, separate lists cover the world, the United States, the same seven regions, and most of the same 30 individual countries. Here, the world's top spot is the HueNino in Hue, Vietnam -- a result that many of us who knew the Vietnam War as a national nightmare will no doubt find ironic. But at least the SeaCoast Inn in Hyannis makes it to number three.
The Justice Department last month accused the Sheriff's Office of rampant discrimination against Latinos in its police and jail operations, prompting an immediate suspension of Arpaio's participation in federal immigration enforcement.
But the former Chongqing party chief's most ardent followers aren't ready to simply accept his fate. Instead, they are challenging an unwritten rule that such high-level political decisions in China are beyond reproach by common people.

* Some people are questioning Ken Hitchcock's decision to start Jaro Halak over Brian Elliott in Chicago? Really? I know Elliott had pitched three consecutive shutouts. We all love Elliott; he's been marvelous. But the Blues' head coach has been consistent about using two goaltenders during the regular season. And before last night, Halak had been in goal for one game since playing on March 17. What, is Hitchcock supposed to let Halak rot? Hitchcock is smart to keep both goaltenders sharp until it's time to make the call on the Game 1 starter in the first round.
"It was pretty intense, the fire burned right down to Jamboree and it was big," Councilman Doug Davert said. "There were embers flying down the road."

But elected and department officials have said recently that Santiago appears to have brought the right combination of administrative leadership and crime-fighting know-how to Irvington. In the process, they said, he has reinvigorated policing in a township of 56,000 long regarded as among the state’s most violent municipalities.
Why is it when you write such articles you don't include all the facts? Mr. Ayala is an illegal immigrant — not a "new American," as our governor wants to call them. I hope the U.S. government does the right thing and deports him.
There are Iraqi children alive today whose parents were killed by chemical weapons, and for The Sun to pretend that it didn't happen is both disgusting and reprehensible.
Newby says her favorite moment in the script is a debate Annie has about God and religion while on a date with her co-worker, Elliot (Jack Bathke).

Thank you for the informative article on the Seita Scholars program ("4-year grad is a first; Mission to help foster kids go to college grows," April 26). As a judge in the Wayne County Juvenile Division, I have had individuals who have participated in this great program, and all those responsible for it deserve a sincere thank-you from our community. I have no doubt that this program will pay dividends for years to come.
Some elements of the film that feel like flourishes have at least a grounding in fact. Tiede really did head to a rehearsal of a local musical production after shooting Nugent, although it was "Guys and Dolls" in real life, not "The Music Man," as it is in the movie. That small embellishment in the film provides Black a chance for a charmingly frenetic rendition of "Seventy-Six Trombones."

Overseas markets rallied as investors became more comfortable with China's recent moves to tighten monetary policy. China is making the moves, such as forcing banks to hold more reserves, to discourage excess lending.
If the actions to date have uncovered just the surface of a wider snooping problem, we need to know more. Accessing tax data to gossip about your work mates is bad, but there are more nefarious ways to use such information. Let’s make sure that this did not happen.
"Certainly, we can all agree the world has changed dramatically," said Bob Niemi, deputy superintendent for consumer finance for the Ohio Department of Commerce. "What that means for Ohioians? There are certainly mortgage options out there, but we also know . . . the bad apples were addressed."
However, I do take issue with those who advocate for for-profit colleges, which have been publicly exposed for their own inadequate graduation rates. I hate to use the old cliche about glass houses, but Schneider and Yin are clearly throwing stones, particularly at those of us in the California community college system.
The festival will be in full celebration mode for the next two years, with two milestones coming up: the 80th anniversary of the art show in 2012 and the pageant's 80th birthday in 2013.
Stay well.
What helps elevate the film is the searing insight Streep brings to Thatcher's aging; she catches every one of the emotional crosscurrents that get to the truth of the matter. But if you come expecting keen insight into the intrigues of her very long political life, or even something as simple as why the Soviets dubbed her the Iron Lady, consider a trip to the library instead.
Marchionne isn't trying to tout himself as some sort of savior for a downtrodden city.
Neither Obama nor Clinton offered information as the administration and the Chinese government sought to prevent the biggest human-rights issue with China since the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations from disrupting high-level strategic and economic talks set to begin in Beijing on Thursday.

In the near future, science develops a way to make people stop aging at 25. Pretty sweet, except that everyone is also genetically engineered to only live one more year. They can buy more time, allowing the rich go on living at 25 indefinably, while everyone else's clock runs out. Justin Timberlake plays a man accused of murder, who then sets out to shake up the system, with a hostage Amanda Seyfried in tow. Though, pretty sure Timberlake turned 30 this year...

It's the panel's sixth series of hearings, and at least one more is expected after this one before the panel issues its report, which is due by March 27. The panel is still awaiting the results of forensic testing on a key piece of evidence -- the blowout preventer that failed to stop the spill. Investigators are analyzing it at a NASA facility in New Orleans.

I usually pride myself on my sense of direction, but the MacRostie Winery tasting room had me befuddled. I was standing at what I figured to be the front door in an industrial warehouse lot just southeast of downtown Sonoma. It was locked, and peering through the cracks of the blinds in the front window, I saw the office was dark.
Schmitt has reciprocated Orban's support by quickly signing into law all of the hundreds of bills passed over the last 18 months by the two-thirds parliamentary majority of Orban's Fidesz party and its Christian Democrat allies. Those bills include some which critics said were problematic and which, such as laws about churches, the media and criminal procedure, were later partially or fully struck down by the Constitutional Court.

Anesthesia arrived on the scene in 1846. Today, we sometimes forget the enormous benefits and alleviation of suffering it provides, focusing only on possible harm. Anesthesia is a necessary accompaniment of surgery and the risks (and benefits) of anesthesia need to be considered every time a surgery, minor or major, is embarked upon.
Don Draper's "rye" of choice is in fact Canadian whiskey. During the mid-century "Mad Men" era, Canadian whiskies (such as Crown Royal and Canadian Club) were often called rye, whether they contained much rye at all. That is not the rye you're finding now on trendy cocktail menus.

Adam: This contest is a legitimate dream match for me as a wrestling fan. I've long been a fan of both men, so the prospect of seeing them face off on the grandest stage of all is an amazing feel. I, too, expect this match to be the best of the night from an in-ring standpoint and just hope it will be alloted enough time to truly become something special, a WrestleMania classic for the ages. While I still don't feel the addition of Punk's family crises was necessary, it helps add to this feud, which I believe is only getting started. Punk and Jericho are too good a pairing to only have one match, and ultimately, I believe Jericho will sneak out with the win and the WWE title. Jericho will be able to gloat and carry the mantle of "best in the world" right into a series of rematches.

Financier Warren Buffet has energized liberals with his still-unverified claim that his tax rate lags his secretary's. If true, "fairness" could mean slashing his secretary's taxes to match Buffet's 11 percent effective tax rate. Somehow, reducing the secretary's taxes never came up. Instead liberals and Democrats demand the so-called Buffet Rule, an instrument for bludgeoning the successful rather than boosting the downtrodden.

Christie said deciding to back Romney "wasn’t that difficult."

But remember that resentment is powerful fuel for political movements, and the fires of backlash are still burning on the American right. The challenge for women (and their male allies) is to hold up a mirror to the real America — where the vast majority of women want and, at key points in their lives, use birth control — and to expose the phony arguments and bogus values of the party that would deny them that right.

Later he tweeted, "North Korea uses the Blender theme, I like their style!"
Despite the turnaround, growth won't be sufficient to prevent America's unemployment rate -- now at a 26-year high of 9.8 percent -- from rising. Economists predict it will hit 9.9 percent when the government releases the latest snapshot on employment conditions on Friday. It's expected to top 10 percent this year.
TBI can worsen the symptoms of people who already have PTSD or who go on to develop it because of, say, a near-fatal bomb explosion. Curiously, however, PTSD appears to be more severe in soldiers who suffer mild head injuries rather than severe ones. The reason may be that prolonged unconsciousness can blot out the memory of the traumatic event.
Crews will continue offline construction of the new interchange ramps at I-465 and Allisonville Road over the next several weeks.

In 2008, the parks department collaborated on a report with the Trust for Public Land that tried to quantify that value. It estimated the direct revenue (from higher property values of homes near parks, sales tax from out-of-town park visitors) at more than $3 million. It put the "wealth-increasing factors" to residents in property value and tourism at $16 million. And it put the cost savings for residents (not having to pay to use parks and lower medical bills from better health) at $371 million.
"We're talented," IWA coach Dan Rolfes said. "But we're not as athletic as we were last year. We have to play a little different style than we did last year."

Today's story about the fall of "lean finely textured beef" -- also known as "pink slime" -- examines both the power of social media and also how little the public knows about what's behind our cheap food supply. And of course, the reaction they have when they realize it. They protest.
In February 2009, voters overwhelmingly rejected a 39-cent operating tax increase. The district has not had an operating tax increase in nearly 20 years, despite growth in enrollment that led to several new schools and additions at others.
"Traditional luxury hotels have frequently had this ability. For customers who haven't asked or didn't know that these kinds of facilities are available to them, we can say, 'Look what we can do.' And it's not reinventing the wheel, because 80% of this was something we already did."
The next phase of the Cascadia rivalry takes place next month in Portland when the Timbers host the Sounders.

The real issue is not his coarse reaction to a young woman, who obviously has no personal shame. This woman is not just a law student. Every since she set foot on Georgetown's Catholic campus this "sexual activist" has been plotting and scheming to get the Catholic Church to renounce one of its most controversial teachings. That makes her a fifth columnist with an agenda and she is using the members of the press to advance her cause to the detriment of my Catholic faith.
Despite the downgrade, Fitch said Italy's sovereign credit profile remains "relatively strong" and that its budget position compares favorably to other European countries.

"If you turn the clock back four, five years ago, we were taking a roof off, putting a second story on; major kitchen and bathroom remodels," said Dunlap. "Most of those kitchens were in the $70,000, $80,000 range, master bathrooms in the $65,000 range. What we are seeing now is those same folks in the same area are doing what needs to be done to keep their homes functional. There is very little of what we call discretionary remodeling right now."

Stump removal is one type of mechanical control. If this isn't doable for some reason, another mechanical control to consider is a barrier. You could build an enclosure around and over, but not touching, the stump. You could make a platform to sit on, to serve as a low table, or as a pedestal for potted plants, depending on the shape of the stump and your preference. When the fungus has rotted away the stump, you could remove the structure, unless you end up liking it there.
Any other big interests?
The few pieces of important legislation of this Congress, such as the payroll-tax break and the debt-limit increase, have been passed by the Republican majority under pressure and duress.

And yet, the last time I talked to a County Council member — just two days after 4-year-old Ellie Bland was killed in March — Josh Wagner said: "I'm still committed to driving on the beach. People just need to understand it's a road."
But they're not taking it quietly. In Indianapolis, neighborhoods around the branches facing possible closure became very active, holding read-ins, marches and letter-writing campaigns.

Julian reserves his most eloquent barbs for Arch Brown, the 71-year-old founder of the Thorny Theater. Julian gives Brown a new name in the book -- but it's a small town, Brown points out, and there's only one gay theater.
To help relieve your symptoms, antihistamines that can be bought over-the-counter are available in eye drops, nasal sprays and oral medications in pill or liquid form.

PHILADELPHIA — Transportation security officials removed passengers from a Bermuda-bound flight today at Philadelphia International Airport after reports that someone was helping to load the plane without a security badge.
The thought of eating man's best friend is, of course, repulsive to us -- as it is, no doubt, to Obama. As these things go, the dog theme has taken on barking-mad dimensions. A pro-Romney poster features a puppy with the caption: "Romney 2012: I'd rather go for a ride with Mitt than be eaten by Obama." Campaign buttons show a dog like Bo and the caption: "Donate or Barack Will Eat Me."
The Obama campaign has been amassing money and information and building a national organization for two years without the distraction of a primary race. At the end of March, Obama's team reported contributions totaling nearly $197 million. The Romney campaign reported contributions of more than $87 million. Mr. Romney, of course, has been forced to spend heavily to fend off rival after rival, and President Obama currently has 10 times the amount of cash on hand. Still, according to Bloomberg News, that advantage slips to a less impressive two-to-one when money raised by the Romney super PAC and other independent Republican groups is taken into account. Ultimately, the total expenditures to elect Mr. Romney could match what is spent to keep Mr. Obama in the White House.

where she spoofed her merged roles. Maher pretended to call Moviefone, and Huffington's heavily accented voice said, "Hello dahling, you've reached Moviefone. Now playing: 'The Kids Are All Right.' But the kids are not all right. They are suffocating under a mountain of debt, accumulated mostly during the Bush administration."

Dressel says if towns are no longer allowed to charge fees for activities like youth soccer, the programs are unlikely to survive.
Nearly four years ago, NPI, at the invitation of the Cleveland Foundation, decided to initiate a pilot deconstruction project. The appeal was environmental and economic. A two-person crew working about a day and a half can demolish a single-family house. A crew of four to six, working about a week, can deconstruct a similar property. Additional jobs could be created through businesses like furniture-making, selling the salvageables or recycling materials like shingles into new products. Since 2008, the nonprofit has overseen the deconstruction of 45 properties.

Jaleel White said he grew up with no rock in his house, but he managed to learn to move like Jagger for his tango to "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction." It was smooth, but lacked punch, according to the judges. Carrie Ann loved it, calling it "funky and weird." Len like the "humor" of it, but said it needed "more aggression." Bruno loved the "Jagger beginning" and said it was a little "underpowered." Should we call him Jaleel Jagger from now on, wondered Brooke? Scores: 8, 7, 7 = 22

ANSWER: Wisdom teeth (third molars) were necessary eons ago when humans had a coarser diet and larger jaws. With evolution, our jaws have gotten relatively smaller and, in many cases, there isn't enough room for them to erupt fully or into a favorable position. Often, these teeth will only partially erupt, leaving a flap of tissue over a portion of the crown of the tooth. Food and bacteria get under this flap and cause an infection. Even if the teeth fully erupt, they are so far back in the mouth that it is difficult to keep them and the surrounding gums clean and healthy.

El Palmar is a classic, mainstream Mexican- American restaurant, right down to the neon decorating accents and the sombreros nailed to the walls. The décor is hokey, half-hearted and clichéd, just the way we like it. The menu is all but indistinguishable from thousands of other thriving restaurants like it throughout California. It's that way because the concept, with the nips and tucks for the American palate, is a proven winner.
Gas levels were not actually dropping, but the alarms indicated that PG&E had lost the ability to monitor pressure levels, earlier reports in the investigation have shown.
Regarding "Texas leaders with balanced approach need to step up" (Page B1, Wednesday), columnist Patricia Kilday Hart hit the nail on the head when she wrote about business leaders not showing leadership in opposing actions by Gov.

The buoyant, fast-moving, gorgeously sung, zestily played production of "The Pirates of Penzance" now at the Marriott Theatre - directed by Dominic Missimi, with especially ingenious choreography by Matt Raftery, and with supremely hip musical direction by Ryan T. Nelson (plus a fine orchestra led by Patti Garwood) - doesn't mess with tradition.
Only 10 of the 886 scripts Ensemble Studio Theatre received for this year’s one-act-play marathon made the cut. It’s a pity, then, that so many of those are underwhelming. “Marathon 2010: Series B,” like its predecessor, Series A, is highly uneven, with the best stuff coming after intermission.

Some — mostly those sneering from the outside — maintain that Cleveland fans have created a toxic environment for their teams by constantly bemoaning their fate. That the culture of losing and woe-is-me mentality feed off each other. That Cleveland fans would not know what to do with themselves if one of the major pro teams ever won the whole thing again.
Glover said he feels as good as he has since he paddled out to the ocean the weekend before Kapalua. He has made three cuts, though his best finish was last week in New Orleans when he tied for 66th. Even so, he expects to make a strong title defense at Quail Hollow.

"We won't be able to make our bills if these budget cuts go through," Martin said. "That's going to happen to so many people. Their loved ones are going to be in a nursing home and it's going to cost the state more money."
Ruby arrived in horrible condition. She was completely emaciated, just skin and bones. Thanks to the loving care of her foster family, Ruby is more healthy and beautiful than we ever could have imagined. Ruby is a smart lady and has already learned the commands sit, lay down, lay down over there, paw, kennel up, and hugs. She is working on her loose leash walking too. Ruby gets along well with dogs, cats and even has met chickens and rabbits through a cage and is pretty much uninterested in them! Ruby adores children. She is nervous with men and her foster family is working to teach her that they are okay. Ruby appreciates it if a man leaves her alone at first and gives her a few minutes to warm up. It just takes her a bit of time! She has quickly learned to love and respect the man of the house in her foster home. Ruby would do well in a quieter home, as she is a quieter type of dog. Gentle corrections do the trick for Ruby, and a harsh correction would upset her feelings. Ruby is a true GEM and deserves a loving home! She will continue to stay in foster care learning and growing while she waits for the perfect family to find her!
America's reputation was sullied throughout the Arab world when the horrible abuses at the Abu Ghraib prison complex outside Baghdad became public. It was further damaged by the Bush administration's repugnant policy of waterboarding captured enemy fighters to extract information, and the equally indefensible practice of "extraordinary rendition," which sent captives to be tortured in friendly third countries known for their willingness to violate human rights.

That night, I watched LeBron be LeBron in Detroit. Late in the third quarter, he did what I didn't think was possible in a real game: go basket-to-basket in four dribbles. When I first reviewed the tape, I thought my eyes were lying to me. I kept replaying it. Four, four, four. Absolutely amazing. And I truly don't think he walked.

Williams might be leaning to joining Dallas, and play in his hometown – with or without Howard at his side. Maybe, though, the only thing stopping Williams from forcing his way to Orlando via a trade is Howard.

There was a time when any major city had at least three to four local department stores, Whitaker said. And each store took pains to identify with local customers. They partnered with civic organizations, ran art contests for children, or opened store auditoriums for community meetings. Recently, shoppers have been saddened to see their hometown store brands gobbled up by corporate conglomerates. Today, finding a niche in a retail environment that is increasingly homogeneous can be a challenge.

They're made from cranberry concentrate, and most mix in lots of white grape juice concentrate and/or apple juice to add sweetness -- or sugar. Often, there's more of the other fruits than the cranberry. But these are drunk for fun, not for the antioxidant benefits of cranberries.

Toni Malone's towering burgers may be the most ambitious in all of Los Angeles. Yet there are no contrivances here: no custom-ground meat blends, no willful denial of ketchup and no flavors fortified by what might otherwise amount to a chemistry experiment. Instead, the restaurant's signature burger is a tender, hand-formed turkey patty, a crispy lattice of turkey bacon, a firmly fried egg, a single slice of cheese, sweet mashed yams and wilted collard greens on a gently toasted sesame-seed bun. It's a triumph of maximalism, a burger in expert balance despite its seeming overabundance of ingredients.
The recruiting process for kickers is far different from that of the other position players. Colleges concentrate on filling needs at the other positions and then the coaches decide whether kicker is a position at which they can offer a scholarship. Otherwise, they'll try to coax a kicker to accept a "preferred walk-on" spot, which usually, if things work out, turn into a scholarship for the players' sophomore season.
Other entrees reveal execution problems. The accompaniment to a flat-iron steak ($21) -- broccoli raab -- was undercooked and horribly bitter. The salmon ($24) with beurre blanc, cauliflower puree and sliced pears came with overcooked heirloom carrots. The farro risotto ($16) with brussels sprouts and chanterelles was too rich, with a cloyingly sweet jus that overpowered the hearty grains.

Rauschenberg was widely regarded as a principal bridge between Abstract Expressionism in the 1950s and Pop art in the 1960s, but he did not subscribe to any narrow doctrine. His work also influenced the emergence of Neo-Dada, Minimal, Conceptual, Post-minimal, Process and performance art. His deep and abiding interest in printmaking facilitated a major revival in the medium, and his achievements in lithography were instrumental in the creation of a contemporary market for prints. In Europe, the humble, everyday objects of the Arte Povera ("poor art") movement expanded on his use of cast-off materials retrieved from the trash bin and the attic.
“It was going like gangbusters,” said Dave Cippoloni, head of both the robotics team and the academy. “The new administration came in and they shut all these programs down. The robotics program was lost in 2008, and the last year we ran it, we came in first place out of 63 schools.”

Providence bartender Vincenzo Marianella agrees about the ice and the bubbles. "When you're shaking it," he says, "you change the texture of the spirits. Shaking adds not only ice and dissolved water but bubbles. Try putting 2 ounces of gin in two jars and shake one while you stir the other; you'll find they have different flavor and texture -- for a minute or two. After that they taste the same. But the first sip is the one you're going to remember for a long time."

We sympathize (slightly) when Mr. Oberlton, a relative newcomer to the system, observes that his pre-renovation basement office repelled visitors, including job applicants. Some level of upgrade was likely justified. But wood floors, a glass-encased conference room, interactive white boards, a vaulted ceiling and entirely new heating and air conditioning system?

The reason I am writing about this great man in my sports column is because during his long career as a CEO of many hospitals, he always made sure his people found time to treat many athletes, both amateur and pro, during his many years of service.

If you feel faint, cross your legs and tense your leg, abdominal and buttock muscles when warning symptoms first appear. The resulting blood pressure boost may stave off the faint or at least give you time to get to a safe place. Intense hand-gripping and tensing of the arm muscles can also help. If possible, lie down, ideally with your legs elevated, before you fall down. These simple measures can help keep you from adding the insult of injury to the discomfort of feeling faint.

It also asks Geithner to justify a part of the proposed deal that, the letter says, would use fines imposed on mortgage servicers to modify loans, including reducing the principal owed, for borrowers not affected by the processing irregularities in question.
Hey, Jason: My biggest knock on Shurmur is that he tried to go from Point A to Point D without touching Points B and C. By that I mean he gave Colt McCoy too much responsibility right off the bat. I think he should have leaned on the running game he inherited early to help the offensive line and McCoy settle into a rhythm together. I do think the absence of the off-season minicamps with his new team has much to do with the slow development of the offense.

The turning point, according to trade expert Ravi Batra, came in 1968, with the conclusion of the so-called Kennedy Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations. Before then, he argues, the U.S. economy had been relatively self-sufficient, with combined imports and exports rarely exceeding 12 percent of GDP. Only after 1973, when the OPEC oil embargo fell like a wet blanket on the growth prospects of energy-poor industrializing nations such as Japan and South Korea, did foreign firms and products begin to enter U.S. markets in force.

"It seems like we can always do something better than what we've done. I guess that's part of the drive that keeps us creating, taking something that comes into our minds and turning it into a tangible piece of art. Hopefully there's still some demand for it. But it starts with us wanting to do it. Needing to, really. I look as music as something I need to do.
In Washington, mortgage funds are lobbying for policies that favor their investments, particularly mortgages held in securitized bundles. They want more mortgage balances to be lowered, which might help mortgage bonds perform better. Big banks generally oppose such reductions, which lock in banks' losses on the loans.
"No," he said.
In 1996 leadership passed to Jo Carole Lauder, the wife of Ronald Lauder; she steered the foundation away from simply supplying loaner art to diplomatic residences and instead toward building a permanent collection at American embassies in more than 140 countries. Lauder quickly transformed what had been an elite, rarefied program into something more accessible and democratic. "Embassies are the visible face of our country," says Yale's fast-talking dean of art, Robert Storr, who moonlights as chairman of the organization's professional fine arts committee and guides its curatorial mission. "The art installed in and around those government buildings allows foreigners to have a glimpse of our cultural production."

Learning new words adds gray matter, as a matter of fact. (Your brain doesn't have to shrink with age.) And adults actually are better at learning new languages than kids, if you can put aside linguistic habits (the brain gets trained to ignore sounds that it doesn't need for comprehension) and embrace the nonsensical. That's how kids learn; they associate sounds with objects, then recognize sounds and words as labels, then link words with meaning. So to learn a new language, whether it's with a class or through audio tapes, remember these tips:

Paterno certainly had detractors, as well. One former Penn State professor called his high-minded words on academics a farce. He was criticized for making broad critiques about the wrongs in college football without providing specifics. A former administrator said his players often got special treatment compared to non-athletes. His coaching style often was considered too conservative. Some thought he held on to his job too long. There was a push to move him out in 2004 but it failed.

The monkey's hands were very soft, very velvety as they danced over my neck and shoulders. The creature was chattering gently, right next to my ear. Then it tugged. I tugged back. The monkey tightened its grip and pulled harder. Not exactly the story I'd planned to write: Padangtegal Ubud, Bali - Primate Garrotes Writer in Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary. But there I was in the surreally mystical refuge of macaca fascicularis - the Balinese or long-tailed macaque monkey - being strangled to death by two little hands and four shiny strands of red coral.
Let's hope "The New Zach Braff" learns from the original Zach Braff to strike while the iron is hot and not dither away his potential waiting for that perfect "next project" to come along. For filmmakers, there is but one life lesson -- you don't get better by sitting around waiting.
The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago tossed out two of Black’s fraud convictions last year, citing that landmark ruling. But it said one conviction for fraud and one for obstruction of justice were not affected by the Supreme Court’s ruling.

A third of American children and teens are overweight or obese. They are at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, in which the body can't make enough insulin or can't use what it does make to process sugar from food.

I started out at about a mile. A gentle mile. Then I started walking a little bit farther, after a week. Got a pedometer and got a sense of how long it takes to walk a mile. After a while you get to know the distance by how many steps you've taken in how many minutes. A mile to me is about 2,100 steps, at a pretty good clip -- about 15 minutes. Remember, this is your walk. You're not reporting to anyone or keeping score. It's all about burning some calories, speeding up your metabolism, strengthening your heart.

No formal history training but a general interest in history, including naval/WWII history. I don't try to be a historian; I'll post a photo, supply a few sentences of context, and let the viewers take what they want from it. I'm probably more of an amateur urban archaeologist than anything. I've always loved maps too, and I regularly post historic maps. It's neat to discover, for instance, that an old building is rounded on one corner because a long-gone railroad or streetcar track made a wide turn at that intersection.

Maybe it is. Romantics have had a rough time of it on the pop playground over the past decade or so. There aren’t too many happy love songs near the top of the singles charts these days. Lovers in contemporary songs tend to be losers — people who have "caught feelings" and are about to be trampled by the harsh realities of relationships. Fidelity and devotion are fool’s gold, and those who let their heart win are doomed to despondency and derision.

The first-term Republican governor set off a firestorm of speculation in the national media and in the highest tier of American politics when news broke last week that he was seriously considering a White House bid after more than a year of ruling it out. Top Republicans said Christie would be an ideal challenger to President Obama, but they also expressed concerns that Christie would not have been able to mount a successful campaign in time to win his party's nomination, and that his moderate views on gun control, same-sex unions, immigration and climate change would alienate the most conservative voters.

Mr. Malouf, who is on his third heart (his first transplant was in 1989 and what he hopes was his last in 2003), says more changes at Petersham are likely; he is working with existing kitchen staff and wants to hire people who are at least as good or better than he is to get through the transition.

Certainly if anyone can slow down the Knicks juggernaut, it is Kidd and the defending-champ Mavericks, who have suddenly caught fire with five straight wins, against pretty good competition—they’ve beaten the Nuggets twice, plus the Timberwolves, Blazers and Clippers. Their tough stretch continues on Friday with a game in Philadelphia, which is leading the Atlantic Division.

Kidd, even at age 38, is still a heady defender, and Dallas’ zone defense and shot-blockers will give Lin some different looks—the Mavericks held Denver point guard Ty Lawson to just three points on 1-for-8 shooting last time out. Said Nuggets coach George Karl, “Dallas has turned into an incredibly good defensive team.”

Obama's surge will bring to 51,000 his Afghanistan escalation since March. Supposedly this will buy time for Afghan forces to become adequate. But it is not intended to buy much time: Although the war is in its 98th month, Obama's "Mission Accomplished" banner will be unfurled 19 months from now -- when Afghanistan's security forces supposedly will be self-sufficient. He must know this will not happen.

For Whedon, Cabin in the Woods' third-place start is a victory in that it meant the film escaped the shelf upon which it had been sitting since its original studio, MGM, went bankrupt.

The tea party's role in the GOP's 2010 takeover of the House has given some anti-deficit activists hope that the White House and congressional leaders will finally swallow major spending cuts. Tea party activists nearly triggered a debt-ceiling crisis last year, and they played a key part in budget negotiations that have teed up $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts over 10 years unless Congress takes new action by December, after the Nov. 6 election.

Dear Margo: I recently was baptized and joined the Mormon Church. I really enjoy my new "family" except for one person: the bishop. This feeling is taboo because people act like he walks on water. I say he is just a man appointed to a position. This man didn't like me the minute he met me. When I started at this church, I was in crisis, and I told a couple of people about it. They said go to the bishop. He turned me down flat-out and said, "We don't help people financially." That was a bald-faced lie, and I knew it. The excuses I got were that I was not a member yet, that he was stressed, blah, blah, blah. As time progressed, my problem became worse. Again, I was turned down, and he didn't even call me by the right name. I corrected him twice about my name, and he still got it wrong, which was proof to me that he was doing it on purpose. Do you think I am making something out of nothing? And to whom do I go to let someone know about this person? I think he treats me badly because I am disabled. (I think this because there are other disabled people who also dislike him.) — Disillusioned

French onion soup is hard for me to pass up when it's on a menu. There's really no such thing as a bad French onion soup  you're pretty much guaranteed some kind of success simply by melting cheese, cooking the onions until they're limp and velvety, and heating the broth. But the flavor profile of this popular soup is wide-ranging, from robust and beefy to mild and sweet. This version landed on the sweet side, reminding me of the French onion soup Matt Woolston sometimes serves at the Supper Club.

The FBI is still analyzing the explosive, which was intended to be concealed in a passenger's underwear. Officials said it was an upgrade over the bomb that failed to detonate on board an airplane over Detroit on Christmas 2009.

Step Three: Think long-term. It's relatively easy to paper over a one-year deficit, but if legislators are serious about eliminating the state's structural shortfall, it requires permanent taxes or permanent spending cuts.

Edwards, who had three receptions for 79 yards, is looking for a lucrative contract after this season, and plays like that won't help his cause.

Finally, the argument that Big Labor in Ohio is tapped out after spending $40 million in the last election is simply wishful thinking.

When I was a kid, Bo Jackson was one of my favorite players, not just because he was an astonishing blend of speed and power, but because I loved his six-shooter touchdown celebration. Kansas City defensive end Neil Smith and his "home run" sack dance are something I'll never forget. The thought of Deion Sanders high-stepping and tap dancing after an interception return still make me smile. The fact that Barry Sanders simply handed the ball to the referee after a score was great too, because it made him unique in his own classy, understated way. But I never once wished that the entire league behaved like Barry Sanders.
For these reasons I urge voters to reject this measure.
Don't know a spotted towhee? Learn about bird species in Golden Gate Park and Lake Merced on Sunday at the Birding by Bike ride.

Unless you're cruising Prince William Sound or the Weddell Sea, it's likely you'll run into beaches and snorkeling trips. So how do you keep valuables (including watch, ID and ship-board card key) safe while in the water? The Wet Safe by Design Go is a fanny pack built like a diver's dry bag, including the same roll construction and a zip-like seal. It's big enough to hold a wallet, a cell phone and an iPod, but that's a lot of gear to trust to a rubber bag. In a bathtub test, it kept my cell phone dry after 20 minutes submerged.

This new federal tactic targets what skeptics have long said was the soft underbelly of state-level medical pot laws: the fact that "prescriptions" can't be filled at a pharmacy.

I'm not a poster child. I'm not a rebel. I am a priest. While it pains me that not all of my Christian brothers and sisters are able to recognize that as an objectively and theologically true statement, perhaps now is not the time to insist on recognition-or worse, to instigate conflict.

There's no need to try to make it about me.

* Speaking of QBs, it's not set in stone that the Browns will keep three quarterbacks on the active roster. If they stock up on receivers and keep four tight ends, the third quarterback may pay the price. Contributing to the decision might be Jarrett Brown's 1-for-6 performance with one INT in sporadic preseason play. This is not to say the Browns have soured on Brown as a developmental prospect. In fact, Shurmur said he feels good about "some of the progress" Brown has shown and believes he has a lot of ability. But everyone knows Brown needs a lot of growth before he can perform at an acceptable level in an NFL game. Could be practice squad-bound.

Over the past several months, Mitt Romney has been an excellent presidential candidate. He has performed superbly in the debates. He has outorganized his rivals.

I found a young philosopher-musician who is acutely aware that much of hip-hop music has swerved in a profane and self-destructive direction.
Go for the ZAGGfolio Zagg ($99 at zagg.com). I found Zagg's first-generation keyboard case to be wretchedly untypeable. In fact, I could type much more quickly and accurately with the iPad's built-in virtual keyboard. I reckoned that it was because of the downsized keys.

If you got on it early, you probably found some fun ones. I shot out at Newport Beach today, where there was some solid 4-to-5 footers in West Newport before the wind kicked up. Huntington was all jumbled and closed out, but if you headed north of the pier to the Cliffs there were some big bombs hitting. Salt Creek had size and the winds stayed down.

Yes, the Yankees are ruthless; yes, as Rich suggests, "There are only three possible outcomes to a Yankees season: embarrassment (2004), disappointment (2005-08, 2010), and satisfaction (2009)." And yet, peer beneath the surface, and you'll discover something unexpected, that the truest Yankees fans, the "fans of long standing," are "obsessive, passionate, and most astonishing to me, they live in constant fear. No matter how much success their team has, they still expect the worst."

He is listed as day-to-day after beginning tests under the league-mandated concussion policy on Monday in Oklahoma City.

​The former Seabra’s — one of Newark’s perennially popular restaurants — is now known as Rio Rodizio, and the name is a clue to the main attraction: the nonstop orgy of grilled meats known as rodizio. It’s all-you-can-eat meat, and it’s up to you to tell the waiter no mas. There’s an enormous salad in case you’re striving for nutritional balance. I’ll say this: If you don’t add rodizio to your NCAA tournament eating resume — whether here or at one of the Ironbound restaurants — you’ll be all the poorer.

Early in his career, Mr. Kan developed an interest in renewable energies, and he still proudly shows a fading picture of himself as a young, long-haired legislator visiting a Colorado wind farm. He discussed wind power during a parliamentary session in 1982, drawing a rebuke from the then-minister of science and technology, who, according to the legislative transcript, chided him: "Don't use it as a reason to reject nuclear power; don't get too excited or carried away."

Second: The only way to wirelessly share Photo Journals from iPhoto is by first uploading them to iCloud, which generates a unique Web link to that Photo Journal. This link can then be shared with others by email, but it's frustrating that Apple didn't directly integrate a way to share these creations via Facebook, Flickr, SmugMug or other photo sites. The emails generate terribly long URLs that look ugly in Facebook and don't include any thumbnail images. A spokeswoman said Apple would address this issue in a software update.

It was around that time that Los Gatos locals who had seen him dining with his family in prior years saw him instead partying at the bars. With a restricted driver's license from a 2010 drunken driving arrest, an armed body guard who doubled as a driver escorted him around town. He would often mix water with $200 bottles of Silver Oak cabernet. He was kicked out of at least one bar and at times could get loud and argue with other patrons, said Pete Jillo, a friend and owner of Gardino Fresco on Santa Cruz Avenue. But he had a big heart, Jillo said, ﻿and was a generous philanthropist. He even bought paintings from a local homeless man.

"In a perfect world, a year seems like a reasonable time for a young, well-educated person to get back on their financial feet, but it depends on their personal financial situation. If (they) have to go and pay off a bank or lost a home and lost a job, things can get pretty severe," said Hilary Martin, a certified financial planner at the San Jose-based Family Wealth Consulting Group. "Just having them move in with no (exit) agreement and kind of a hush-hush idea about money because you don't want to pressure them is not really a good idea. Be supportive but also have expectations."
Other ventures off-property included West End, the hip, dusty little town at the end of the island and a 15-minute drive from AKR. Although all meals were included in our dive package, we sometimes went for dinner at one of several excellent restaurants. Tongs Thai Island Cuisine was our favorite. The liveliest bar scene was at Sundowners, but that required leaving the kids behind on movie night. The shopping in West End erred toward the hippie: parachute silk pants, kites, wind chimes, that sort of thing, but the Lenca pottery, with beautiful black and white geometric designs made by Honduran highland women, was worth the drive.
Although the Golden Gate Bridge is one of the city's leading tourist attractions, bringing in 10 million visitors a year, it offers remarkably few facilities for visitors. At the San Francisco end of the span, there's a small plaza off the metered parking lot that features a statue of Joseph Strauss, the designer and chief engineer of the world-famous span, a chunk of cable from the bridge, and a small weather-battered interpretive sign. Nearby are a snack bar and the roundhouse gift shop.

Once home to the hill Nisenan, a subset of the Maidu tribe of native Americans, the site was first visited in the 1840s by hunters and fur trappers, then quickly transformed into a bustling mining and supply camp in Auburn Ravine during the Gold Rush. It officially became known as Auburn in 1849.

Puts, the composer in question, seldom relaxes his grip on the listener. There is no emotion his writing cannot conjure. In the course of two hours he integrates an astonishing range of forms and styles: waltz and fugue, 18th century opera and 19th century song, a folk-like Scottish ditty (complete with bagpipes), atonality and more. At its best, as in the heartfelt choral lullaby of Act 1 or the shattering funeral march of Act 2, his music is as powerful as any being written today. "Silent Night" is, improbably, Puts' first opera; it shouldn't be his last.
Both the president and the prime minister stressed the special connection between their countries. As Obama put it, "We are bound to Israel because of the interest that we share" and also "our common ideals," adding, in this election season, that American support for Israel is bipartisan. Netanyahu spelled out some of those ideals: religious freedom, minority rights, the rule of law, women's rights -- all still woefully lacking elsewhere in the Middle East, despite all the hype about the "Arab Spring."

But the Japanese love dining out, and most aren't on an expense account, so follow the locals and enjoy.

Satisfying lunches could easily be found for $12-$14, including beverage.

"It was easy to bake," said the person who made it for sharing. "You bake the crust in a square pan for a few minutes, then pour the lime filling on top. More baking then took the longer time to be sure it was done in the center."
Dmitri never married but believed he would have made a great father, much like his own was, he told The Times in 1989: "It was a very rich relationship. We were very good friends.... He made my life infinitely richer, more entertaining and equipped me for creative endeavors of my own."
Maybe the best we can do for now is to adopt the transparent approach of John Calipari, the Kentucky coach. He makes no apologies for what he does. He recruits players who plan to turn pro after a year or two and doesn't pretend that he expects them to graduate. In that sense, Calipari is being more honest about college basketball than is the NCAA.
The charges also accuse Virgin of keeping nearly half the proceeds from fundraisers -- cookie dough and discount booklet sales by the school's soccer and basketball teams.

Kilbane tales abound. Seated for a deposition, he and a hostile expert once leaned on opposite sides of a glass tabletop and traded glares. The glass cracked. Shards flew. The lawyer kept grilling. The witness began to sweat. He gradually took off his jacket and tie, unbuttoned his shirt, asked for a bathroom break and fled to the airport, never to testify.

An Inspector General report largely cleared Sanchez of wrongdoing, but he wrote in his own 2008 book that he was denied a fourth star in part because "Senate Democrats were intentionally putting pressure" on the Bush administration "not to send my nomination forward."
Jack Alan Oremus, as trustee of the John A. Oremus 1994 Exempt Trust, paid cash for a 5,392-square-foot home with pool at DC Ranch on the western side of the Silverleaf Club in Scottsdale. Oremus is a member of the Oremus family, which founded Prairie Material in 1948 in Bridgeview, Ill., a provider of ready mix, specialty concrete and aggregate. The home was sold by Scott T. DeGhetto and his wife, Ava. Scott DeGhetto is a managing director of Credit Suisse in the investment-banking division based in New York. The DeGhettos paid $1.7 million for the home in September 2009.
Films range from a "bikerafting" adventure on Alaska's outer coast to music video spoofs, to three French guys halfway through their ride around the world (the jury's enthusiasm about that film inspired the Frenchmen to pedal a detour into Portland to make an appearance Sunday night, Crotty says).
The information was market-moving, traders say. In the hours after the lunch, some traders wagered that the odds of a bidding war had declined.

April 30, 2010: United board meets and gets overview of proposal.
The highs and lows tell me the menu needs cutting. Clemons is a talented and ambitious guy. But it takes discipline to come up with ideas, then give them the ax if they don't work. I would say one-third of the menu could be trimmed. That would make quality control easier, and the remaining dishes could get even better.

One year, a nurse pulled one of our volunteers aside. There was an infant who was critically ill. The baby was not likely to live very long, and the parents were keeping vigil by his bedside. Tears flowed freely as the gift was given. Later, after her son had died, the mom wrote us a note thanking us for allowing her to receive the only Mother's Day gift her son would ever give her.
Giusti's research on anthocyanins and other phytochemicals also involves the best way to process and store these compounds. She says one of the good things about the dark-colored juices is that you can immediately tell when their active components -- the anthocyanins usually -- have gone bad. If you see a pomegranate or acai juice that's turned from a bright red to a dull brown, for example, pass it up.
As I've reminded throughout the years, the real story isn't about a holiday; it is about a holy day. It's about two people summoned from their home and forced to travel to register so the Roman occupiers could count them. The couple had no place to stay. One brief look, and the innkeeper announced there was no room at the inn. Their baby was born in the cold, in a working barn, set in a rough manger on a straw floor.

A Hanover-based trucking company with a long history of safety violations — including a fatal crash in August — has been ordered off the road after federal regulators found it to be an "imminent hazard" to the public.
Those parts were all well and good. I can understand why unmarried people without kids see those next steps as life-ending rather than life-affirming. I myself was once petrified of having a child, and it wasn't so long ago that I wouldn't even head out the door until 10 p.m.

For textiles, synthetic dyes took over, but the use of cochineal dye moved on to food. In the U.S. in the 1900s, the article notes, cochineal “began to appear in commercial products of the United States primarily as a food dye, as in pork sausage, pies, dried fish and shrimp, candies, pills, jams, lipstick and rouge, and the brightly colored maraschino cherries.”

That's why Romney's shift to Obama's side in the president's battle with House Republicans over student loans may be his most instructive flip-flop yet. It shows that Romney will do all he can to soften his underlying radicalism. His goal is to deprive Obama of ways to reveal the concrete impact of free-market utopianism -- and the price of the cutbacks Romney embraced by endorsing Rep. Paul Ryan's budget.
If they don't do the little things, the Buckeyes have seen it will lead to big things for the opposition. It has happened for two straight weeks, and if the Buckeyes want to be the type of defense they have been in recent seasons, the missed tackles can't continue for much longer.
A. Early October rains may have caused new sod to suffer root rot problems. Reduce waterings to only when the soil and turf begin to dry, which should be about once a week. If you haven't by now, apply a fungicide to prevent further decline. A number of products are available at local garden centers. Also, apply a starter fertilizer for new lawns available at your garden center following label instructions. These usually contain the three major nutrients needed for good root growth and disease resistance. This should feed your lawn until late winter, when the first-of- the-year fertilizer is applied at the end of February or early March.

"I thought we were tight on defense and guarding the ball rather than our man," Roy said. "That's the biggest adjustment we've made this year, really focusing on guarding that ball and moving with that ball instead of our person. Only the ball can score. Your man can't score if he doesn't have the ball. He's really a decoy. So the biggest thing is helping and trusting that if I get beat I have four guys rotating to help. Not one, but four guys helping."

Universal Studios Hollywood doesn't have much wiggle room, which means planners will have to tear down existing attractions or expand outside the theme park's traditional boundaries to make space for Wizarding World. Universal's 20-year vision plan calls for the replacement of the Terminator 2: 3D attraction and the Water World stunt show. And then there's always the possibility of taking over a part of the studio back lot.

Creme brulee. Once the cream is heated, add flavorings like coffee, lavender, or savories such as butternut squash. Cover the pot, turn off the heat and allow the cream to infuse for at least 10 to 20 minutes. For stronger flavors, Citizen Cake's Elizabeth Falkner suggests an additional step: Leave the flavoring in the cream, cool, cover and store overnight in the refrigerator before straining and reheating. For a perfect creme brulee that is creamy and delicate, it is imperative to not over mix or over bake it. Baking should always be done in a water bath to allow even cooking and to prevent a crust from forming.
Off they go to investigate, and we see, playing the role of Bramble Haus, the Lion and the Rose Victorian bed and breakfast inn, actually located on Northeast 15th Avenue, near Lloyd Center. Never mind the fact that the plotline says the victim ran from the bed and breakfast to the bridge because it was so close. Only us locals are likely to find her ability to race from the Lloyd District to Troutdale, barefoot and nightgown-clad, remarkable. But it's still pretty funny, nevertheless.

Restaurants with tablecloths are practically an endangered species in L.A. Here, tables are draped in white cloths, which does a lot to tamp down the noise level.

Essentially, it's the post-9/11 odyssey of four adventurous but unworldly buddies -- one of them, Monir, vanished during the adventure, and is presumed dead -- who traveled from London to Karachi, where Asif was to be married, and took a side trip to Afghanistan on an impulse. After getting caught in a Northern Alliance roundup of Taliban fighters, they did several months of hard time in Afghan prisons, then did much longer -- and much harder -- time at Guantanamo until British authorities verified their claims of innocence, brought them home and set them free without charge. (At the moment when, according to the FBI, the trio was spotted at a rally attended by Osama bin Laden and Mohammed Atta, Shafiq was working in a British electrical store, and Asif and Ruhel, who had criminal records, were doing community service in Tipton as parolees.)
In March, the California State University Board of Trustees voted to give Garcia – the outgoing president of Cal State Dominguez Hills in Carson – the maximum pay raise allowable under a new executive-compensation cap approved by trustees in January. In addition to her base salary of $324,500, she gets free housing at the presidential estate and a $12,000-per-year car allowance.
The crowd, of course, was right there with him. The bigger question: Was the band on board? Jane's broke up in 1991 at the height of its popularity and fought during several failed reunions over the next two decades. In fact, the band's new CD is only the fourth studio album for these godfathers of alternative rock. With such a tumultuous history, it's no wonder that today Farrell's mind is on the future. Or what's left of it.

Is he, as the former Pennsylvania senator avers, a consistent "full-spectrum" conservative, a pioneer on tough policy, and the only candidate who can provide a clear contrast with Barack Obama?

Build nothing; light-rail transit (LRT); bus rapid transit (BRT), either in its own dedicated lanes or in managed lanes that are added in Interstate 94's center median, with stations in the middle of the freeway. Those managed lanes would be free to buses, motorcycles and car-poolers.

The lottery, which Ohioans authorized in 1973, headquartered in Cleveland, has been a patronage nest for both parties.

Jhoulys Chacin (11-14, 3.62 ERA in 2011) did not have a strong spring, slowed initially by biceps tendinitis and later by a blister on his right index finger. Both compromised his velocity. He ended the spring reaching 92 mph on the radar gun, with impressive sink. For Chacin, a quick start is imperative after he closed last season with a 4.58 ERA after June 21. April is his best month (2.83 ERA), and he has held the Giants to a .211 average in seven games. Barry Zito (3-4, 5.87) is a shell of the pitcher who won a Cy Young. He's changed positioning to the first-base side of the rubber, but does not have much variance between his 83- to 85-mph fastball and other pitches. Troy E. Renck, The Denver Post

Is there any recognition at the absolute highest levels of team ownership/management of two huge sources of future problems ... 1. The Sox have simply been unable to develop an effective farm system under Ken Williams (witness recent Baseball America ratings); and 2.

It is a blindingly pretty spot. Despite the sci-fi sounding name, Syngenta is a major world producer of flower seeds. The farm at the western edge of Gilroy used to be the locally owned Goldsmith Seeds, a name familiar to home gardeners, before it was bought out two years ago. On this crisp morning, with the sun climbing above the Diablo Range to the east, the flowers were in full bloom, a blazing display of one small piece of the Gilroy region's efforts to build a local agri-tourism business.

Rating: TWO AND A HALF STARS NV Schramsberg Mirabelle North Coast Brut Rosé ($24) This may be a good transitional wine to Champagne, as one panelist noted. It has more overt Chardonnay, some vanilla notes and a touch of lees on the nose with orange-raspberry marmalade, citrus zest and apple skin flavors. A touch herbal, oxidative and astringent at moments, it nonetheless is interesting and refreshing.

The flood, as bad as it was, helped break down some of those political barriers, at least for a time. But this year there's no flood threat, and it's a presidential election year. The urgency has dissipated.
Whatever the reason, the data show that even for those drivers stopped by police, officers cut more slack in 2010 than before. In 2008, police statewide gave warnings to 39 percent of motorists they pulled over. By 2010, the rate of warnings had risen to 43 percent.
"I have been the one who has publicly, along with the president, been very, very critical of some of our European allies for not fully embracing Turkey in the economic union, for not fully embracing Turkey as part of Europe. The way we look at Turkey is, it's the gateway, it's the hinge between the east and west. It has inordinate influence," he said.

Not long after I became a college president, I met with a young man who was concluding an outstanding career at our institution as a politics major. His efforts had earned him a full scholarship to a prestigious graduate program. During our conversation, I learned he was the first in his family to go to college, and that his undergraduate studies were made possible in part by a Pell Grant from the federal government.
“In 1996,” says DJ Shadow, 39, “there was a recognition that hip-hop was the most vital form of music out there, and if you were making any kind of music, you had to engage with it. Everybody from jazz to rock to pop was influenced by it.”

Mangini gets additional love for the wad in his cheek. It made him look cool.
Considering that Paul Schurick faced as much as 12 years in prison for his role in a 2010 election day robocall that fraudulently urged voters to stay home from the polls, the sentence handed down today to former Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.'s 2010 campaign manager may sound a bit light. Mr. Schurick will serve no jail time and pay no fine. He was sentenced to 30 days of home detention, four years of probation and 500 hours of community service. And he shamefully continued to insist on the courthouse steps after the sentence that a clear attempt to suppress black votes was actually a "counterintuitive" effort to turn out African-American supporters of Mr. Ehrlich. But that is not to say that the former political operative's conviction and sentence were insignificant, or that some good can't come from this sorry episode.
Crowder is getting warier of his many enemies and more cunning in his plans to dispose of them. He talks the whispery talk, and he walks the hands-in-pockets, rooster-in-the-barnyard walk. A scheme to rig the sheriff's election using the sister of the incumbent works beautifully, and when Quarles leaves the sheriff's office, where only minutes earlier he was happily telling the sheriff to move his stuff down the hall, Crowder is waiting with his specialty, some threatening, smoothly delivered locals vs. outsiders populism.

"For example, if one member of a couple is highly socially intuitive and the other member is not, the highly social one could be the designated member of the pair who enables their social network and who makes social arrangements for the family, whereas the one who's not very socially intuitive takes care of the house, manages their finances and so forth.

The initiative would bar unions from using automatic withdrawals from members' paychecks to raise money for political activity. Instead, labor would need to persuade members to write checks or make transfers from their bank accounts, an obstacle that would be difficult to overcome.

In a departure from the norm, Woods isn't doing a pre-tournament news conference before this week's Wells Fargo Championship -- his first PGA Tour event since he finished tied for 40th at The Masters.

About 80 miles away in Mississippi, Adam Mayes was seen that same day at a market in Mississippi with his long hair chopped off. He told another customer that it would be cooler in the hot Southern summer; investigators would later warn he might have cut the girls' hair to disguise them, too.
Oklahoma led by 12 in the first 8 minutes. The advantage grew to 19 as Ellenberg came out hot in the second half and Oklahoma held the Wolverines without a basket for the first 561/27 minutes.
"You know what I don't get," Marson said. "They made the first- and third-base coaches wear helmets, but the umpires still wear just a hat under their mask and they're closer to the ball than anybody but the hitter and catcher."

“We knew that we were going to staff this one,” said Sorge after the contest. “Sometimes when you get backed up with some rainouts you hate to have, particularly, your better guys sit and wait. We’ll just keep them on a rotation and get their work in. We’ve got conference games on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, so today, instead of them ‘penning’ (‘bull-penning’) them, (we put them) on some inning counts. They just went out there (pointing to the pitcher’s mound) to do some work instead of doing it over there (motioning to the bullpen). I think we could have thrown in the bullpen, but you get a little bit different juice flowing through your veins when you’re out there in a game. So that’s obviously a little bit more productive.”

Years of experience have taught me that real reconciliation cannot occur without two essential ingredients: trust and truth.

If you guessed that Chiang is the Golden State's controller, you get high marks (and extra wonk credit if you can list what, precisely, the controller does). Chiang became much more controlling than the average controller after voters passed Proposition 25 in November 2010, the initiative that wisely did away with the two-thirds vote requirement for the Legislature to pass a budget.

Longer distances did not result in significant differences.

Secondhand smoke is responsible for a large number of smoking-related deaths.

Indeed, the "uninsured crisis" itself is properly regarded as a symptom, not a cause, of high costs. The insured consume two and a half times as much health care as the uninsured. This massive consumption is largely a result of being insured, and therefore immunized from the direct cost of health care. It's as if you paid a $10 co-pay for a tank of gas and your car insurer paid the balance. The roads would be even more congested than they are now! Further, one third to one half of this spending does not contribute to better health. The blunt fact is that most of us are overinsuredbut few of us are prepared to accept that fact, so most politicians ignore it.

Maybe the larger problem is his point of view. He begins his article by criticizing the festival's mission "to break the barriers of stereotypes" because the lineup does "not actively push that agenda" because of (in part) our film about mariachi music. Maybe he doesn't realize mariachi is the national music of Mexico? By that rationalization, every American film with jazz or the blues must conform to stereotype. I think he's confusing breaking stereotypes with something else. Just because a Mexican plays mariachi music doesn't make them a stereotype. Just like a Chicagoan playing the blues doesn't equate stereotype. What is stereotypical, is an American assuming that every Mexican holiday is Cinco de Mayo.We would appreciate it if Mr. Stamets could rethink his (admittedly brief) comments about our film and his view of Chicago Latino Film Festival's mission and lineup in a context that maybe he isn't (as of yet) qualified to make them.

For the meat course, the kitchen features Kobe beef, with tiny caramelized baby squash, a pad of potato puree and a green peppercorn sauce. The roasted dourade was less impressive, with an almost fishy flavor and tarragon-scented maitake mushrooms, a corn sauce that didn't add much, and a straight line of red pepper "snow."

“I was really happy with my performance,” Williams said. “The crowd definitely was behind me.”
He was right. "King Me," written and directed by Yaw and produced by him, Glazen and Keith Potoczak of Think Media, is a great documentary. But it also has a gentle comic element that puts it just this side of a Christopher Guest mockumentary. Filled with endearing characters who are deadly serious about their fringe pursuit, it is the "Best in Show" of checkers. Except it's all real.
øEmployers tell me about such scenarios every week.
“This one kid came over and I thought, he’s going to put some money in the sock,” Johnson said. “He looked around, picked the sock up and went running down the street.”
That's all fine and well if both partners are happy with the new order of things. More often, however, vanishing sex lives cause couples distress -- especially if mismatched desire leaves one person feeling routinely rejected, and the other incessantly hounded, perpetuating a nasty cycle of resentment.
Although hemp advocates argue that hemp and marijuana are the same in the way that Pomeranians and St. Bernards are, a DEA spokeswoman said the growing of any cannabis plant without DEA approval is a felony.
I could have used a road map to view Ashley Page's "Guide to Strange Places," which San Francisco Ballet premiered Friday night at the War Memorial Opera House, but unfortunately it wasn't until much later that I realized that there actually was a map in front of us nearly the whole time, a guide to parts unknown and unfathomable.

The global cruise industry keeps growing no matter what happens — shipwrecks, fires, mysterious illnesses, missing persons, a sunken economy. The Cruise Lines International Association Inc. expects 17 million passengers on the ships of its member companies this year, up from 16 million last year. But isn't another Titanic pushing the industry's luck?
"Let's assume they got a reasonably decent chain of custody on the weapon and reasonably decent recovery on the cartridge cases, and identifiable bullet fragments. Then they match that to the weapon. Bingo," he said.

Chicago's Olympic run has been guided by the advice of city planner Mr. Burnham: Make no little plans.
In the past few weeks, however, opinion polls show the FDP appears to be getting a lift from its leader in the politically important state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Christian Lindner's success so far seems to be based on his strategy to distance himself from the FDP's one-issue image as a tax-cutting party, and his emphasis on cutting the state's debt.
At the nurse's request, a doctor ordered a chest X-ray and a ventilation/perfusion lung scan.
This time, the DEQ is supposed to make a decision by May 7. The agency told NorthernStar that it could withdraw and resubmit again. Otherwise, the absence of information "will likely lead to a denial of certification."

Yet quantum behavior is frequently spooky, and experiments have validated entanglement very soundly. In a recent article a useful analogy was given. Two entangled particles are like a pair of tumbling dice. If you stop one to see which number comes up, the other dice must show the same number; it has no other choice. If the two dice are separable, then the measurement of one doesn't affect the other. Being separable seems normal to us. We never expect two dice to exactly match. If they did, Las Vegas would go out of business, since chance would disappear.
"The flavor and consistency was nice and creamy. It had only 60 calories and very few carbs or fat - or protein or anything for that matter," she said.

Merkle said he's been pleased that the UAW has shown a recent willingness to work with automakers. The union, for example, has said it wants the companies its members work for to be profitable.

Born in Chicago, she grew up reading the legendary Mike Royko and listening to the television commentaries of Len O'Connor. Carol's own news career began in Knoxville, Tennessee at WBIR-TV in 1972. In 1976 she moved to WSM-TV in Nashville as the anchor of the 6:00 news and established herself as one of the market's top reporters. In 1978, she returned home to Chicago to anchor and report for WMAQ-TV. In 1985, she was promoted to anchor the station's 10:00 newscast, a position she held until May 1997.

In 2003 Carol began writing a weekly column for the Chicago Tribune and was hired by the Chicago Sun-Times in August 2004.
The biggest beneficiary of that attitude change is senior Brianne Rigg. A 6-foot-2 forward, Rigg didn't perform well the past two years on teams that Binning said were a bit on the self-centered side. This year, however, she's getting a steady stream of passes in the post, and she's responded by averaging a team-high 16 points and 10.6 rebounds, up from 12.1 and 8.1 a year ago.
Rupp could be within reach of the U.S. record of 27 minutes 13.98 secondss, held since 2001 by Meb Keflezighi. Salazar wants conditions as optimal as possible, which explains their indecision.
After all, he was a geologist, not a bankruptcy attorney. And he hardly was a political juggernaut. He'd lost three races for Congress, a race for Vanderburgh County Council and a GOP convention fight for secretary of state. Until he won election in 2006 as state treasurer, his only prior political success was two terms as a Vanderburgh County commissioner from 1994 to 2002.
• Allow business owners to offset taxes on gains from one of their businesses with losses from another, and to carry forward those losses for 20 years (S1540). The State Division of Taxation estimates it will mean as much as $400 million in annual lost revenue, though sponsor Lou Greenwald (D-Camden) called that figure "overly aggressive." "It will be less tax revenue but will create more income for the individual owner that they can replenish back into the business," he said. It passed 76-0 in the Assembly and 39-0 in the Assembly.

To be sure, much has changed in 20 years. Two of the L.A. police chiefs who followed Daryl Gates have been African Americans. We have a Latino mayor and a black president. My City of Angels that for many dark days became a city of fear gradually turned its attention back to mismanaged schools, irrational real estate prices and the fate of the Dodgers.

So how does a patriotic American decide which lobby to believe? You might start by asking, Which one is more obviously trying to buffalo me? Clearly that is the Billsters (let's call them) with their ludicrous attempt to create patriotic sentiment around the dollar bill. Then you might ask, Which side has hired Frank Luntz? Once again, it's the dollar bill people.

That's what is being whispered in the ear of every player who comes to the par-5 seventh hole at Big Met in Fairview Park. Do you belt the drive 240 or more yards around the trees, challenge a drainage area and set up for a mid-iron approach and a likely birdie? Or do you respect the odds that a slightly wayward drive will be severely punished, play short off the tee and set up a pitch with a chance to beat par?

Sone shows a creative California flair with "Lissa's Staff Meal'' ($18), clearly demonstrating there's much more to sashimi than knowing how to slice raw fish. The chef makes "noodles'' out of long chewy strips of cuttlefish and mounds them in the center of a burnished origami-like bowl with a julienne of daikon, burdock root stained orange to look like carrots, precise rounds of sliced okra, orange salmon eggs and sea urchin. A quail egg, held upright by a dab of wasabi, is meant to be blended with the fiery condiment, poured over ingredients and tossed. The seductively slick okra, the silky slip of egg and the velvety but chewy texture of the fish play beautifully against the crunch of vegetables. Although there's a lot going on, each flavor is distinctive, revealing a true artistry.
Council members were largely quiet Thursday. Council President Charles Pugh's spokeswoman said he was declining interviews.

Charlize Theron, Angelina Jolie and Cate Blanchett didn't turn up before E! News wrapped up its Oscars 2012 red carpet coverage, but there were so many stunning looks it wasn't hard to come up with our initial top 10. And yes, it includes Meryl Streep. But first, let's focus on a few favorites.
The women's team goes by the name "Nadeshiko," after a mountain flower thought to be a symbol of femininity in traditional Japanese culture.
Things have started to fall apart a little bit for the Golden Bears,who have lost three of their last four games. They've got excellent groups on both sides of the ball, but lately they've been one those cases where when the offense is going good the defense lets down, and when the defense is playing nails, the offense shows up flat. Maybe Saturday's OT loss was a wake-up call, and if the Golden Bears can win out against Oakland Mills and Howard, they'll still be playoff-bound for the second straight season.
Capitol police officers later found Roman Brown, 22, in a trash bin in a hidden area of the zoo. Police said that Brown and another suspect, who had escaped, loaded about 14 metal fixtures into the back of a white 1990 Ford pickup and planned to sell them to local scrap yards.

That's clear when we meet Chelsea, a waitress in a bar, just after she's "power-slurped a worm" out of a bottle of tequila and wound up under arrest for DUI.

Actor Kevin Bacon brought his star power to a charity event Wednesday at the University of Maryland, College Park. The competition - called the "Do Good" Challenge - is part of an effort by the school to make philanthropy more of a focus in academics and student life. The winner was the Food Recovery Network, which developed a system of collecting food from campus dining halls that would otherwise go to waste and distributing it to homeless shelters. More than 100 student groups raised an average of more than $1,000 each over a six-week period for their causes. THE BALTIMORE SUN

Coconut milk — the Caribbean influence — injects a velvety richness to the stewed beef and pork; they soak up the seasoned milk like a Thai or Indonesian rendang curry. Coconut milk also lends its richness to rice dishes. It's widely joked that if you get tired of beans and rice in Belize, you can always have rice and beans. Any Belizean will tell you the two are entirely different.

A qualifying patient and his or her primary caregiver would be required to register with the Department of Consumer Protection. A primary caregiver who has ever been convicted of violating any law pertaining to a controlled substance would not be permitted to register.
(3) Accepting that proximity won't make you close. This is the one you hinted around, but I'll just say it: If you talk to your parents and stand up for your wife and still your parents mistreat her, then you need to release your wife from your kumbaya expectations. Tell her that, while you hope she'll come occasionally, she's welcome to opt out of visits.

Protect your fruit trees from sunscald. It is not uncommon for midwinter's grip to ease long enough to allow sap to rise. When temperatures drop again to freezing, the tree cambium dies on the exposed west side, halting the passage of water and nutrients where the cambium has been damaged. Cover the first couple of feet of your fruit trees' trunks with a tree wrap or white exterior latex paint with a bubble wrap cover, or use pipe insulation to keep the cold at bay.

As a young woman, Robin Azevedo never thought about taking over her family's business, the McRoskey Mattress Co. When her son entered preschool, she looked for a job that would fill two afternoons a week and was hired by her father. "With grown-up eyes, I got engaged in the business and what we did," Azevedo said. "My dad really had no exit strategy. It was that work ethic of, 'You just keep working till you drop dead.' After about 10 years, I approached my dad about taking over the business, and he was ecstatic."
In trying to suppress Danielson's statements to police, his attorney, assistant public defender Tracy Brown, argued unsuccessfully that "officers used the guilt that defendant felt regarding the death of his child while in his care to coerce a statement that is not a true account of the events preceding his son's death."

"Get a divorce," joked Weisl when asked the blogger's question. Weisl recommends Lacrima Di Morro d'Alba, a red wine from Italy that smells almost like a Gewurztraminer, is dry and medium-bodied with floral notes that drinks like a well-made Cru Beaujolais. Other lighter Italian wines could include a Refosco or a Grignolino, also medium-bodied and dry. Another compromise is rosé, and although many people prefer that wine in the summer, a good rosé can be terrific with the right food any time of the year.

An impromptu meeting followed. Conversation about the Ben Stiller movie “Zoolander” intertwined, and by day’s end, they emerged as “Blue Steel,” an end-of-the-bench coalition that would soon demolish the common stereotypes associated with the role of a walk-on. (Blue Steel is the name given to a pose made famous by male model Derek Zoolander, the character Stiller plays in the film).

There's a specialty drink list, but don't come here for complicated cocktails; Local Breeze it better known for their few dozen carefully chosen craft and local beers. Dress down, play beanbag toss, bring the pooch (it's pet friendly, provided Fido is friendly and well-behaved) and feel free to order from the full menu. Be advised: the joint's jumping on First Fridays. And it's a good choice for big groups, as the property is dotted with picnic-style tables and the staff has a go-ahead-and-add-a-chair attitude.

Brees threw for 363 yards and four touchdowns (two each to Lance Moore and Jimmy Graham) — giving him eight in his past two games against the Giants — and even ran for one. Meanwhile, the Giants (6-5) made repeated mistakes to kill any hopes of staying in this one: missed tackles, dropped passes, dropped interceptions, fumbles, missed sacks and blown coverages.
"He is night and day from last year," Cutelli said. "And he's as tall as he was last year, but he's added some size and bulkiness. He's definitely a lot more physical in the sense that he's able to go in and, if someone is guarding him, he's able to shrug them off and make a move with the ball. Last year, if someone bigger was on him, it was a struggle for him to get loose and turn and get a shot off."
The Billikens, like the Badgers, employ multiple half-court sets, rely on a point guard to orchestrate them and, if everything goes according to plan, milk some 30 seconds off the 35-second shot clock. It is no accident that Saint Louis held No. 8 seed Memphis to 54 points Friday in the Billikens' opening round game. That is exactly 20 points less than Memphis averaged per game this season.

NBC EMPLOYEES have some mandatory summer reading ahead of them that won't be anywhere near as pulse-pounding as "Fifty Shades of Grey." A network insider tells us that in an eye-raising instance of life-imitating-"30 Rock," a low-level staffer at the Comcast-owned network went around handing out copies of "An Incredible Dream: Ralph Roberts and the Story of Comcast." The 424-page doorstop of a book was written by William Novak and reportedly commissioned by Comcast, which may have something to do with why the book is not available on Amazon.

As hard as it can be to get kids to eat veggies, I find that salads can often be a loophole in a child's "no-veggie" policy. What's not to love? They're fresh, colorful and often packed with different textures and flavors. Now that spring is here, there's no better way to take advantage of local produce than to showcase it in a salad.

Gerald Wixted, an attorney for the Kotsovska family, argued the woman’s job was more akin to an independent contractor who would not be covered under worker's compensation and is therefore entitled to bring suit.

Only "The King" has hit that whopping number.
They have lost five games they led in the seventh inning. General Manager Jerry Dipoto is actively searching for relief help — “looking under every rock,” he said recently — but his most costly decision might have been during the offseason when he opted not to sign an experienced closer to replace Walden and move the hard-throwing right-hander into an apprentice role in the bullpen.

Whenever I do my own home-improvement projects, I feel as if I'm under her watchful eye, trying to meet her standards, which, of course, being mortal, I never do. When I take a domestic shortcut — and glue-gun a drape, or skip out on painting inside a closet, or use fake florals in a centerpiece, or cook with canned rather than home-brewed chicken stock — I imagine Stewart shaking her head. Hear her tsk, tsk.
I just took a deep breath and stayed put. Others' bad plays help you as often as they hurt you. This was just a time that it hurt.

Mindful of a growing and vibrant Asian American community, businesses are lining up to be part of a two-day celebration of Asian culture in Northeast Ohio.
While smaller banks such as Saigon National are barely hanging on, the big banks are roaring back – due in no small part to their generous Uncle Sam. Bloomberg News reported in November that megabanks such as JP Morgan Chase pocketed $13 billion in profits by taking advantage of low-interest loans from the Federal Reserve from August 2007 through April 2010.
The fact that Salinas broke his collarbone on the play likely had a say in how long the suspension would be. So, too, was the identity of the culprit. Let’s face it, commissioner Don Garber has probably reached his tolerance level with Marquez, and the latest transgression was labeled “violent conduct that demonstrated blatant disregard for the safety of his opponent.”

David Rubin, an attorney for the administrators association, said that while the ruling was disappointing, it also reaffirmed the association’s contention that schools superintendents are allowed to accrue sick time payouts of exceeding $15,000 if they’re slated to get that under contracts signed before the law took effect. It didn’t address the question of whether automatic renewal of a superintendent is considered a new contract.
Now, we are going to look at it and evaluate it, but we want Greg to be a part of this team. I still think Greg Oden is going to be an impact player in the NBA, and that’s the way we are going to approach it.

Out of love for us our mothers sacrificed a good night's sleep for years and years.

That’s because they no longer know Smith as a “game manager,” a label stuck to the former No. 1 overall pick when no one distinguished trait emerged in his five snake- bitten seasons before this one. And although football lore could ultimately leave him stamped a quarterback with no big-play ability, Smith has been doing his best to change that perception amid this unforeseen run to the conference title game.
Party delegates who decide endorsements generally are much further to the right than voters, as evidenced by a recent poll by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California.

The court's four liberal justices all seemed friendly toward the law, while two conservative justices—Mr. Scalia and Samuel Alito—left little doubt they would vote against it.

Last holiday season, she began contemplating the Thanksgiving pecan pie. How crazy would it be to make an olive oil pecan pie with an olive oil crust? Not crazy at all, it turns out. Some might say a pie crust made without butter is culinary sacrilege. But Stephan says she plans to keep pushing the boundaries to see how far she can go with olive oil.

The first hotel so designated in May was Le Bristol, a Second Empire edifice on the fashionable Rue du Faubourg St.-Honoré. I toured it too because Le Bristol just finished a renovation, expanding into another wing and creating new quarters overlooking a French garden for its Michelin three-star restaurant. Le Bristol, opened in 1925, preserves the dignified grand hotel tradition; it has been owned by the same family since 1978. Its guest rooms are large, quiet and lush; old master paintings and tapestries; a small army of uniformed doormen; more floral arrangements than a funeral; and a house kitten.

For adventurous travelers, mas o menos can also translate to opportunity. The decline in foreign visitors - from 264,000 in 2005 to 190,000 this past year through October - means there are bargains to be had, and no hordes to fight. Smith, for instance, negotiated half-price rates at the nearby beaches of Puerto Escondido.

So far, HBO's Game of Thrones appears to be a 13-year-old boy's wonderland, chock full of bloody beheadings and bare-bosomed brothels. Men fight, kill, drink and rape their women. Brothers despise their sisters, and children grow up way too quickly.
"No, why?" Jimenez told MLB.com on Monday. "He was calling me (names). I said already that I didn't mean to hit him. It was a pitch that got away."
Although he became the starting left tackle during his sophomore year, Reiff definitely has the talent to play either side, which could help improve his draft stock. He comes from Iowa, where the Kirk Ferentz offensive line pedigree is nothing to shake a stick at. His strength is a little bit of a question, falling seven reps behind Kalil at the combine, but he makes up for it with sound fundamentals and a wrestling background, which is becoming more and more of a benefit for these guys at the next level.
In Part Two, we examined California's prison system. Although it is the most expensive in the nation, it is plagued by outdated policies, severe overcrowding and a high recidivism rate. Efforts to reform the system are attacked as "soft on crime."

"It could spread into a regional conflagration," he said. "The Tuaregs would see it as a race war. You might get Tuaregs from other countries coming across to join the fight."
Doug also talks about the development of Terrelle Pryor and how last year's Rose Bowl win over Oregon has helped boost his image - and the Buckeyes' image as a team - heading into the 2010 season.
He addressed the earpiece issue by bringing the translators into the courtroom to translate out loud and attempted to stick to the standard script for tribunals, asking the defendants if they understood their rights to counsel and would accept the attorneys appointed for them.

This past Super Bowl drew 4 million viewers, breaking a U.K. record. Even the draft, winding up this weekend, has turned into a spectacle, drawing fans to TV screens and London's NFL-centric bars.

Once you get a name, there’s nothing wrong with interviewing a doctor before you make your selection, Watts added. But first, do a little medical self-assessment and make note of your healthcare needs and concerns, she said. That will help you focus on what exactly you’re looking for in a physician.
2007-10-02 13:11:38.0 Andrew Kamenetzky: Fabio - Like I said in our blog post of Kobe's interview, I don't think Kobe is thrilled with his situation, nor did he really pretend to be. His comments reflected more of an acceptance and determination than any real optimism. I'm not even sure there's much to "believe," really. Unless you're talking about something specific.
It's estimated half the NBA's 30 teams were using similar protocol, but the league desired uniformity. Dr. Jeffrey Kutcher, an Associate Professor of Neurology at the University of Michigan, oversees the NBA's concussion program and consults with team physicians before a player is given final clearance.
West Ward Councilman Ronald Rice Jr.’s idea to sell city buildings and lease them back became the only viable option.

Yes, a Security Council resolution could be useful if it helps smooth the rough transition out of tyranny — not only in post-Assad Syria, but across the Arab world. But Washington has now spent months getting us here — handing the lead to the Europeans, who promptly put the Gulf Arabs in front (albeit, some say, while still pulling the strings). And “here,” now that the Arab League has unsurprisingly proved no match for Assad’s butchery, is back at the Security Council.

Even posturing about the issue might sway a few souls.

Since he came to power in 2009, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has had little regard for the Obama administration's opinions — because the president has not been afraid to speak his mind about Israel's intransigence and a policy which might be dubbed "shoot first, ask questions later."

Regulatory action to cap methane leakage may, then, curtail anticipated production of natural gas in the Marcellus shale that extends from New York to West Virginia.

The latest affront comes courtesy of the burning of Qurans by U.S. soldiers on a military base near Kabul. Military officials maintain the Qurans were being used by imprisoned jihadists to pass messages to other prisoners and were confiscated and destroyed. A spokesman for the NATO-led force said the troops, "... should have known to check with cultural advisers to determine how to dispose of religious material properly." For this unintended action, however, Mr. Karzai wants the soldiers to be put on trial and has asked NATO commanders to allow it. If they do, they will have disgraced their uniform.

Meanwhile, major oil producers like Saudi Arabia already have cranked up production to make up for lost Libyan oil. While this increases the flow of oil right now, it also cuts off spare production that could have been tapped later this year to meet increasing world demand.

We were naïve to believe the event would generate enough revenues to shoulder these costs, but I am convinced that the extraordinary turnout and enthusiasm of spectators and television viewers makes a subsidy/offset of fees worthwhile. I recognize that Baltimore's coffers are not full and that the city made a significant contribution to fix its roads and in terms of man-hours leading up to the event. However, I would hate to see this investment wasted when most of the event's problems are easily fixable with a realistic approach to the revenues generated.

Wine of some sort has been made in North America since the 1500s. In the 1800s, there were significant commercial wineries in California, Missouri, Ohio and New York (Finger Lakes region), and those are just the biggies. Then two agricultural calamities -- Phylloxera and Pierce's Disease -- had a devastating effect on our vineyards. After that came the 18th Amendment, more commonly known as Prohibition, which pretty much took out commercial winemaking in the U.S. until the 1960s. By the '70s and '80s, advances in science and technology provided by University of California-Davis and other research facilities helped us take off in winemaking. Today (deserved or not), we hold a seat at the table of fine-wine producers around the world.

It would seem obvious that the middle class could be defined by money - perhaps broadly, such as those between the 20th and 80th percentiles in income, or more narrowly, such as those earning a certain percentage below or above the median income.

WELFARE CHECK, PEARL ROAD: At 11:55 a.m. June 5, police received a call regarding a possibly disoriented woman in a church parking lot. According to complainants, the woman took 25 minutes to park her vehicle and appeared to be wearing a nightgown as she wandered around the parking lot during a Mass. Police spoke with a friend of the woman’s, who stated that is simply how she dresses. She reported she was wandering around the parking lot because she hadn’t been to the church for a few years, and didn’t know where the entrance was. Police noted, “Other than appearing ornery, she appears to be OK.”
A. How difficult it is depends on the movie. But I didn’t not make a movie because it was difficult. I was just burned out. Utterly. I’d started making films in 1970, and all the time since then I was directing, writing, composing… I was just so tired of it. I had lost some of my passion and I had to rekindle that.

"You can’t commit a crime when you don’t know what you’re doing," Iaciofano told the jury in his opening remarks. "They say it was bound to happen. Your job is to see if the evidence supports that … the cause of this accident was the unbelievable, massive level of cognitive impairment of Gene Baum. Mr. Baum was so sick, so ill, that his drinking was an automatic behavior."

The governor has not said what he will do next, but his options are limited. He could try to place the tax extensions on the ballot without the Republican votes needed for a two-thirds majority, but that approach is legally questionable. He could try to gather signatures to put the taxes before the people via a ballot initiative, but if he does that, the temporary taxes will expire before the vote, so he would be asking for tax increases rather than merely preserving the status quo. That's a much tougher sell.

When herb grower Jan Becker created a spiral several years ago at her Becker's Cottage Garden Herb Farm in Springfield Township, Ohio, she found the design made harvesting difficult. She said that when she made the spiral big enough to accommodate larger plants like basil, she discovered those plants blocked her access to other herbs. She also thought the design used more soil than a raised-bed garden and was attractive only when the plants were lush.

My body has been fine for a long time, but it's been one little thing after another," Kim said. "I hit it better (today) than I've hit it in a long time. To come out here and hit the ball in the middle of the face over and over felt pretty good. I haven't had the opportunity to practice and get better.

The hardest one to handicap. All five women were wonderful. Cruz, who has picked up a few awards already for playing Javier Bardem's crazed ex, appears to be the favorite, but she's been much better in other films (the recent "Elegy" for example). Tomei, who won this award 17 years ago for "My Cousin Vinny," will get votes for screen bravery. She has been mostly naked in her last two films.

In reality, however, the new way is a lot like the old way. It's the way of the Wild West with few rules. Voters should beware.
The 60/40-split backseat folds simply from the rear doors or from the cargo area. Folding it yields 57.3 cubic feet of space and an almost flat load floor. There's also a small storage compartment under the floor. Seats up, the Q5 has 29.1 cubic feet - more than the X3 and EX35 offer with the seats up and enough for a big trip to the grocery store. Its power hatch is a nice convenience, though it's available only in a pricey option package. This feature is optional on the SRX and X3 and unavailable on the EX35.

Stanton has delivered monster RBI totals at every level, starting in high school. As a senior at O'Fallon in 2009, he was second in the Southwestern Conference with 63 RBI, one behind teammate Nick Tindall (64), who established the league record that spring. Stanton's 119 RBI during his career at O'Fallon are the fifth most in the Southwestern Conference since it took on its current eight-school lineup starting with the 2000-01 school year. Stanton is one of 13 players in the same period to compile a .400-plus career batting average.

Kroger outperformed most competitors, with revenue up 7.1 percent for the year to $82.2 billion. Earnings per share were $1.74, up from only 11 cents for 2009 when Kroger took a charge for the decline in value of its Ralphs division in California.
Here's how it works: Borrowers turn over a postdated check for $300 and get $255 in return, to be repaid in two weeks. Few can pay off the loan on time, so they take out additional loans, paying $45 each time, all for the same $255 -- the equivalent of a 460 percent annual rate. It's so damaging that Congress has barred these lenders from doing business with members of the military, fearing that it could affect the troops' readiness.
You published a spate of letters from folks denouncing Congressman Paul Ryan's attempt to end Medicare as we know it. That same day (April 12) the Business section contained an article about an International Monetary Fund study on aging populations in advanced economies.

The left will continue to attack these moral values and the rule of law. I proudly take the arrows of the left and consider it a badge of honor. One state Senate race would not be national news were it not for the fact that for the last several years, I have led the successful battle against illegal immigration on the state, local and national level, most notably by authoring Arizona's SB 1070. It has made a difference here and nationally.

Cowboys: They didn't meet with Claiborne at the combine or bring him to Valley Ranch for a pre-draft visit. They didn't even make the standard call in the week before the draft to get an updated phone number. But they are close to the LSU coaches and had all the information they needed. When Blackmon was off the board for the Rams at No. 6, the pick was for sale. Giving up a second-rounder to jump eight spots into the top six for an elite corner at a need position was a reasonable price. Why make the move? Eli Manning threw for almost 800 yards in two games against Rob Ryan's putrid secondary last year.

His role with the club for 2012 is in flux. With the acquisition of Hiroki Kuroda and Michael Pineda, the Yankees suddenly have a logjam in their starting rotation. So Hughes (5-5, 5.79 ERA in 2011) could move back to the bullpen — where he excelled in 2009 — or find himself traded.

"Farther Away" offers a series of takes on the actual life, as filtered through Franzen's abiding obsessions: literature, birding and (yes) himself. I'm tempted to add Wallace to that list, since the book, or part of it anyway, exists in both his real and metaphorical shadow; among his most widely read essays is an earlier Kenyon commencement address. But if, at times, Franzen himself seems to want to frame the collection as his side of an ongoing discussion with his dead friend about art and life and the necessity of engagement - "I understood," he writes at one point, "the difference between his unmanageable misery and my manageable discontents to be that I could escape myself in the joy of birds and he could not" - that is, ultimately, too reductive a lens.

Skylar went country, of course, with Jason Aldean's "Tattoos on This Town." But here's the thing. She tends to overdo the twang on proper country songs, pulling it back enough on songs that fall outside her comfort zone to seem more like an honest country singer than a theme-park cartoon of a country singer.

Biggest head-scratcher: Gino Gradkowski. In hindsight, it doesn’t appear the Ravens wanted Wisconsin center Peter Konz as much as we all thought that they did. They passed on him twice and didn’t move up to select him later in the second round. Instead, they selected their potential center of the future early in the fourth. The Ravens had Gradkowski, who played center and guard at Delaware, in for a pre-draft visit, but most of Baltimore let out a collective “Who?!?” when his name was called. This looked like a reach at first, but it has been reported that other teams also thought highly of Gradkowski.

As much as his numbers look good against his peers, the way the club shifted him around and took care to skip his start at one point is just as revealing.

To some Americans, this agenda will seem ambitious. To others, it may seem frightening. But House leaders believe their main risk is appearing too timid to their own members. Even if this three-part strategy proceeds with efficiency and success, in two years it will result in a budget freeze, an unsuccessful guerrilla campaign against health reform and the bare beginnings of the entitlement debate.

A good shoe must be anchored by a sturdy, invisible shank, supported by a steely heel and coddled by a cushy footbed. There are myriad things that can go wrong. Most good heels use tempered steel in the shank—a piece of metal in the inner sole—and in the heel. A shoe should be very rigid so that the wearer can rest weight on her heel, without having to balance on the ball of her foot. But some shoe makers insert a weak metal shank or use cheaper materials such as plastic.

Stitching together so many characters and story lines could have turned into herding cats, but the structure meant no single actor had to carry the action all of the time.
I suggest the "thumpers" check more the "literal Bible" they profess to know so much about. At times, the early church at Rome may have presumed things about "their" God that were not that helpful, perhaps believing they had superior knowledge of the creator than those of other places. St. Paul had to call them to task as he wrote in his letter to them "Oh the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways. For who has known the mind of the Lord?"

And Romney? You have to hand it to him. He never delivers a knockout punch. He never gets off the best line. He never dazzles. But he never loses his purpose, he says everything he wants and needs to say, he doesn’t get flustered, and he is fluent and purposeful.
-- Business is business. Hustlers on both sides of the bay saw opportunity in the chaos. Scavengers dug through rubble for anything that might sell, which explains the grimy sugar bowl on display in "Aftershock" -- a yellowed sales tag proclaims the pockmarked pottery to be a genuine "souvenir of the fire of April 18 1906, found in the ruins of the Palace Hotel, by A.T.

Hiring an architect isn't cheap. Depending on the scope, the general rule of thumb is that you will pay anywhere from 10 to 15 percent of the construction value of your project. How much will you spend on construction costs? That depends, too, on the kind of project and the level of detail. Mike Bader said that bathrooms and kitchens, which include plumbing fixtures, custom cabinets and expensive floor coverings and tiles, can easily cost $300 a square foot. Expect to pay about $150 a square foot for more straightforward living spaces and bedrooms.

After all, Hart said, "You just can't go up there and play your tunes and wait for the hand-clap. That's not what it was all about. After the song, if someone clapped, it was kind of weird.

But this past December, lawyers and regulators involved in the US Fidelis bankruptcy case met in Austin, Texas, to figure out how to split up what's left of the company's assets, according to court records.

Eurail Pass: If you're traveling long distances over several days and changing trains and countries, the best bet is to buy a Eurail pass rather than individual point-to-point tickets. The passes, available only to non-European residents, come in a dizzying array of combinations and prices. There are student, family, youth, senior and large-group discounts. Prices also vary on how many days you want to travel or how many countries you want to visit. Do your research, plan your trip carefully and you can save money.

I think Anna's movement has been fantastic. It's everything I wanted to happen. In fact it's happened a little sooner than I expected. At the same time, I think it's not exactly a "revolution." It was only a successful protest since the former goes on for a while. Two years back when I started writing columns, I would have been considered a lunatic for imagining the India I would like to see. But when I see a movement like this, I think there are plenty of people who want an equal society based on excellence. It's very nice that the youth lent their time and energy to the cause. But you can't fix a nation in 10 days. The youth has to be prepared to sacrifice more if they want to see a better nation.

The film opens by introducing the rookie cop Rama (Iko Uwais), who recites his morning prayers on a prayer rug, undergoes a grueling physical workout, and then tenderly kisses his pregnant wife goodbye. He will be our avatar. The van carrying his team parks in front of the building and is met by a gray-haired man wearing a bulletproof vest over a bright sports shirt. He is the lieutenant who has set up the raid. Wearing clothes that make you stand out from all the others is a dimwitted move, but then again, how bright is Tama (Ray Sahetapy), the crime lord, by barricading himself on the TOP floor? Elementary strategy suggests he can be cornered there. He reminds me of my beloved movie cliche, The Climbing Killer.

But, warns Giusti, a superhigh ORAC value, which is measured in a test tube, doesn't automatically mean the juice will perform as well in the body.

The story starts in 2002, with Mr. Einhorn rightly proud of his ability to spot companies with shoddy accounting practices. He sells their shares short, betting on a stock-price collapse.

* Is Hank (Russell Hornsby) ever going to start wondering about his partner?: One of the best scenes of the episode involves Spencer, Lucinda's godfather (also a Murcielago, as the bat monsters are known) being interrogated at Portland police headquarters. Nick and Hank suspect him of killing the stepmother. In the interrogation room (lit, as ever, like an Old Masters painting, all deep, rich shadows, as if the Portland police are drastically conserving electricity) Spencer tells Hank and Nick, "I know what you are, and I guess you both know what I am." Uh, oh. Nick and Spencer already know that one's a Grimm, and the other's a Wesen. But Hank? Instead of picking up on Nick's nervous look, wondering what Sterling is going to say next, Hank says Sterling's accurate self-description -- he can emit a loud screeching sound and all that -- is an attempt to play "the crazy card." The momentary tension was great -- let's hope the teaser for next week, in which Hank apparently sees Monroe as a blutbad, makes Hank get more serious about getting answers to what's been going on.

A few days before the MCA opening, Johnson stood in the center of a gallery and cast a seriously-don't-talk-to-me-now look on his face. Museum workers swirled around him and artwork sat on the floor, covered in blankets; bubble wrap lay strewn about. Johnson was quiet, moving from room to room. He bundled his dreadlocks together, tied them in a bun, then a moment later, he released them. Then repeated the process.

It may be a prejudice, but people are continually surprised to find this caliber of restaurant in the Westin Hotel on Third Street just off Market. I can't tell you how many times people have written me to let me know they were skeptical but became converts after tasting Richard Corbo's take on rustic Venetian-inspired food. His specialties include a stellar sformato, a dense souffle made with lobster and ground polenta when I visited; perfectly done arancini (risotto balls); and halibut cheeks with polenta and jalapeno-mint marinara. With a sexy interior and one of the best outdoor spaces in the city, it's a great addition to the dining scene.

Hey, Don: Casspi is not off to a good start, granted, but he also has only one season remaining on his deal. But the Cavaliers had to make a decision on Hickson.

By the way, Hickson was removed from the starting lineup this week in Sacramento. Eventually the Cavs will get a draft pick from the Kings and most likely a first-rounder in the next few years.

Marriage is a sacred commitment and is already in the dumper in this country which mocks God with divorce rates of 60 to 70 percent — even in so-called Christian households. How much do you think it will be respected if you allow those who are unable to understand cleaving together as a sacred rite rather than an immoral act of fornication? If the bill before the Maryland General Assembly is passed then there will be no way that a man should not be able to marry his best friend Fido, or his mother-in-law or even a pedophile to marry a young boy or girl.

--Or try mindfulness, a kind of meditation in which you sit quietly, eyes closed, and focus only on how each breath feels (in, out, in, out). When other thoughts intrude, gently refocus on breathing. After 10 minutes or so, begin to notice your surroundings as you quietly breathe. Then go about your day with this feeling of calm awareness. You'll find that pain isn't running you over. --Movement also reduces pain sensitivity. Water exercises or gentle yoga can help stop your whole body from becoming a pulsing pain generator.

Excessive tarmac delays have been on the government's radar ever since a Northwest Airlines flight was grounded during a 1999 snowstorm at Detroit's Metro Airport, leaving passengers without water or working toilets for more than seven hours.

Husted wants to set uniform weekend days for election boards to be open for early voting, and he wants to bar the county boards from sending absentee ballot requests to every voter.

There are so many exemplars of not giving up and then making it to the top of the talent and non-broke rung. Another is actor-comedian Jim Carrey, who had to live in his car for more than a few weeks before his big break arrived. As chronicled in one of my A SENIOR MOMENT webcasts (www.startribune.com/video) a few weeks ago, even Gregory Peck, one of the greatest actors of all time, often slept on benches in Central Park because he couldn't afford to pay apartment rent during his fledgling acting days in New York. (SIDEBAR MEMORY: I'm honored to state Mr. Peck kindly took me under his wing as a professional and eventually personal friend beginning in 1968. He signed one of my favorite photos with him and me as being my "podner", and taken during the filming of THE STALKING MOON, with Eva Marie Saint and Robert Forster, the latter appearing in what was then his second feature film. He most recently played George Clooney's father-in-law in THE DESCENDANTS.)

The report also mentions that lower-wage dads are less likely than those with good-paying jobs to be involved with their children.

Danny Knobler, CBSSports.com: "So you still don't believe Ryan Braun? Sorry, I can't help you. So you're now claiming that the process is rigged, or that baseball didn't really want Braun suspended? Sorry, can't help you. Go ahead and tell me that it's ‘corrupt,' as one Twitter follower wrote after Thursday's decision was announced in Braun's favor. Go ahead and call him a ‘coward,' as another tweeter said. Sorry, can't help you, because in that case you're not interested in justice. And as for the idea that one not-guilty verdict taints other positive tests, seriously? When one criminal trial ends with not-guilty, do we empty the jails because every other conviction must be wrong, too? If baseball or any other sport is going to have a drug-testing system, there needs to be a way for a player to appeal a positive test. If there's going to be an appeal process, it needs to be fair enough that if the player makes a legitimate case that the test was flawed, he gets off."

Is the Deep Throat story over? Yes, in the sense that it will no longer be treated as a mystery. In spite of the million questions we'll be hearing--and there are and will be many serious questions--the MSM will stick with the heroic narrative. Mr. Felt was Deep Throat. Deep Throat was a great man who helped a great newspaper put the stop to the lies and abuses of an out-of-control White House. End of story. Why? Because in celebrating this story in a certain way journalists of a certain age celebrate themselves. Because to bring unwelcome and unwanted skepticism to the narrative would be to deny 20th-century journalism--and 21st-century journalists--their great claim to glory. Because the MSM is still liberal, and the great Satan of all liberals, still, is Richard Nixon. And because, as Ben Bradlee might say, It's a goddamn good story.

It has been about a year since Jeter scrapped the swing changes he made with hitting coach Kevin Long, and nine months since his return from the disabled list. During his three weeks away last summer, he reconnected with one of his first hitting coaches, Gary Denbo. Together, they untangled a swing that had become foreign.

One of the weirdest is the absence of women's events – no pro surfing contest in Hawaii this December despite Carissa Moore of Hawaii leading the women's top tour and Courtney Conlogue of Santa Ana topping the total points board.

1. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver): "Alien" - At the top of our list we've got a woman so tough that mere humans aren't enough of a challenge for her. Over the course of four movies, Ripley continually bests murderous space monsters and a cold foreboding cosmos where no one can hear you scream. Ripley pretty much redefined the role of women in the sci-fi/action genres taking them from victims or damsels in distress to tough-as-nails lone survivors. She is the queen and we are all her subjects.

And I was finding a lot more excitement in that because people really listen to it and you can share the enthusiasm they feel for those great old songs. But then Tom starting writing these original Platinum Load songs that had that same feeling, and it felt like we were really saying something that had to be said."

Try the zucchini planks ($4.95), hand tempura-battered rounds of thin-cut veggies served with a creamy horseradish sauce. There's plenty to share among two to four guests. What Pebbles fan can turn down something called the nutty cheesy salad (small $5.95, large $8.95)? Not me. Although not identical to the salad lunch during the Pebbles reign in downtown Orlando, it was darn close. (You can check out the Pebbles original recipe today on my blog orlandosentinel.com/thedish.) What made this simple concoction of shredded fontina and Cheddar cheeses, sesame crisps, sliced olives, nuts, tomatoes and torn lettuce so great was the balance of ingredients and the kitchen at the Genuine Bistro handles the equation quite nicely in its interpretation.

One day, we went nowhere until we boarded the St. Charles trolley (which went nowhere faster), riding past the Audubon Park and Tulane and the ubiquitous Mardi Gras beads hanging from the power lines, stepping off in Carrollton, home of Jacques-Imo's restaurant and the Maple Leaf Bar. We went nowhere to the former, then the latter, where almost everyone seemed to be going nowhere.
There's something about playing the Orioles that brings out the best in the Rangers. In August 2007, Texas set a modern-day scoring record in a 30-3 rout at Camden Yards.
Peeta asks Donald if he knows anything about the quickstep. Given his display of "DWTS" superfandom last week, I'm sure he does. Peeta says she's given Donald a very hard routine. In rehearsal, Donald drops into a split (impressive!) and them comes up wincing (ouch!). This song, "Stay the Night" by James Blunt, starts out so slow -- I hope it picks up or their quickstep is going to look really weird. Donald's kicks and flicks are high and high-energy. The song only ever briefly seemed to be as fast as they were dancing. Weird music selection there. Len apologizes to Donald and says that he undermarked Donald last week. Tom points out that this admission may be a first from Len.

Auctioneer Keith McLane resembled Fred Astaire as he worked the ballroom at a charity event one recent Saturday night. Suited up in a tux, he moved lightly from table to table, and motioned with long, tapered fingers. He took care never to point directly at a bidder  too in-your-face, he said  instead gesturing solicitously, palms up, as if merely presenting possibilities.

"On Sunday, Sept. 11, I went downtown to the Cleveland Pops concert. A policeman was sitting in his car, and I asked him if the concert was going to go on because it was raining. He said he had just gotten word to open up a street because the concert was canceled. Another SUV drove up and asked the same question and was turned away. On the 11 p.m. news I saw that the concert did go on. I was very upset and really wanted to go to it. Also I would like to moan about all the parking meters with orange covers on them saying 'no parking.' Why do they do that? I think it is bad public relations for the city when so many people can park on the street and it doesn't interfere with the flow of traffic."
Oddly enough, the lack of rain may be a boon to fruit and vegetable growers, said Ed Wengryn, research associate for the New Jersey Farm Bureau.
St. Louis catcher Yadier Molina left the game in the ninth inning after being hit in the back of his gloved hand trying to snag a pitch by reliever Mitchell Boggs. Preliminary X-rays were negative.

Striking at an opponent without intending to annihilate his ability to resist (by either conventional or unconventional means) is like waterskiing without skiis.

Roughly 15 percent of districts -- most of them very small -- did not report 2011 teacher pay data to the state.
Gov.Martin O'Malley's proposal for a 6 percent sales tax on gas is a bad idea. With the current 23.5 cents per gallon tax, consumers are already struggling to make ends meet. When a Maryland citizen doesn't have enough money to pay his bills, he is forced to cut his spending and adjust his budget. As steward of the public treasury, the same standard should be applied to our governor.
The next wave of valley stock launches may well be made by less-sexy enterprise software companies like Palo Alto Networks, which filed plans earlier this month for a $175 million offering. The Santa Clara-based maker of network security products reported $119 million in fiscal year 2011 revenues, which would have placed it 142nd on this year's list.

Notes: Thompson suffered a shoulder injury last spring and had surgery. He also has undergone surgery for an appendectomy. It would seem unlikely the two procedures would have anything to do with him having a heart attack. ... Riley noted Thursday that Thompson had gone through some difficult physical issues to reach the point where he would be scrapping for a spot in the defensive line rotation when spring ball starts March 12. (There are three practices before spring break). ... "I was so proud of him. He's come a long way since he got here,'' said Riley. "I just enjoyed being around him. He had that great, great smile. Everybody liked Fred, is the best way to say it. He was a big 'ol guy. Fun to be around. ... he was like the perfect teammate.''

Our ride began peacefully, humming along under the incandescent haze of the slumbering city. Then the buildings petered out, along with the streetlamps. The van climbed toward the Andes, its windows frosted and headlights flashing around switchbacks. As the first streaks of sun crested the horizon, we approached the summit known as Patapampa Pass and pulled over to allow our driver to rest and refuel with a cup of coca tea. Perched dizzily at a staggering 16,000 feet, amid thousands of apachetas (the small stone cairns built as offerings to the goddess Pachamama), and staring out of the silvery altiplano, I realized the scene gave new meaning to the adjective "breathless."

McKinnie, I can't really figure out. Sometimes he looks really good, and other times, he struggles with speed rushers. I thought his conditioning would be his biggest weakness this year, but really it's his lateral quickness. (They could still be related.) The fact that neither LaMarr Woodley nor James Harrison will likely be 100 percent next week (if they play at all) is a fortunate break for Baltimore.
The players have said all the right things in welcoming Marshall into the mix, but that's because the perception is that this is a clean slate for the troubled receiver.

Yet Marylanders could show Will and Kate a jolly good time, too, if given the royal nod. From pub crawling and shopping on Thames Street in Fells Point, to steeplechase races in Cockeysville, not to mention locales with royal pedigree — think Annapolis and Queen Anne's County — there's plenty here to remind them of Merry Old England. We even have castles.

The common name for Myosotis may have had romantic origins, but modern gardeners can never forget them for more mundane reasons. They spread and spread and spread. After a very pretty froth of blue in spring, they turn into weedy clumps that invade every corner of the garden and are particularly inviting to mildew.
One advantage of built-in cabinetry, besides providing an uncluttered look, is that cabinet doors can help keep equipment contained during a temblor -- as long as doors are closed, that is. An office armoire, with doors and latches, would serve the same purpose. Make sure the armoire is strapped with flexible-mount fasteners that "allow furniture independent movement from the wall, reducing strain on studs," advises a 31-page brochure, "Putting Down Roots in Earthquake Country.'' The pamphlet is free from the Office of
"That would definitely be one of them. And the Duke hit from my sophomore year. The N.C. State hit from my junior year. The interception against Clemson this year for a touchdown. And the Miami touchdown."
It could get worse.
Foster said she grabbed "every paper cutter I could get my hands on and we have spent all day catching up. We also discovered that if we used ballots from the bottom of the stack they worked better.

The interior is more impressive than you'd expect. However, I'm still looking for the story behind the Pinocchio emblazoned on a mirror downstairs and on a mural above the upstairs bar, where he appears to be stuffed in the attic. He's lying on the ground, tied up in strings, and I'm not sure if it's bone and tendon hanging from his foot or mozzarella cheese. Same goes for the iron weights in the next panel. Or is it tomatoes? And what's the picture in the last one?

The Whitecaps (4-2-2) had few chances from the run of play, but took advantage of a restart on the lone goal.

Earlier trials found the gel useful in women bothered by low desire following medically needed surgery to remove their ovaries. (Those sex organs produce roughly half a woman's natural testosterone. Though often thought of as a "male hormone," testosterone is tied to libido in both sexes.)

Those boxes are often like mini time capsules of 20th-century American retailing and culture: at one end of the spectrum we have the carved wooden, hand-painted Nativity set and old glass ornaments that have been in the family for generations; other packages contain more "modern" accoutrements, including 1960s Styrofoam angels, silk poinsettias and Melmac serving bowls. The newest cartons are filled with contemporary decorations such as SpongeBob or Rams ornaments and made-in-China light strands which never seem to last more than two or three years.

They've done South America and now they want to get more exotic. They want the next frontier, which is Asia. Or they've been to Asia and done the basic places and now want the deeper experience," perhaps being guests at a wedding or spending time in locals' homes.

Revelations of neglect, theft and other misconduct by guardians and conservators prompted Minnesota lawmakers to strengthen oversight of the unlicensed profession in 2009, but advocates say the system still falls short. While guardians and conservators must register with the courts by 2013, they are not required to pass any tests or possess any specialized skills. Applicants are required to submit to a criminal background check, but court officials don't have to determine whether applicants have been disciplined for misconduct by a state licensing board.
The 25-year-old's response echoes Kevin's answer about being a twin. “I don't know anything different.”
But the length and depth of the recession make it more difficult to model behavior, and the slow recovery could complicate things. Xu Cheng, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics, which uses state economic and political data to predict election results, said his team had altered its model this year to account for "the grumpy voter effect."
It is not a student's fault if he or she is being shuttled from one parent or grandparent to another, has no time or place to do homework or is never encouraged to read.

The only fly in the ointment was "Night Ferry," a monotonous and astonishingly feckless tone poem by the orchestra's other composer-in-residence, Anna Clyne. The piece consists of a few repeated churning scales, with the entire orchestra playing almost throughout, and nearly always at full volume. An orchestra this great deserves better.

Chacin was the first casualty last Wednesday. He's won three of his last 21 starts. And as I speculated, he wasn't right and hasn't been since he showed up at spring training with biceps tendinitis.

I don't blame the guy for not wanting to do an interview on a day in which he was wrestling with a big life decision. I don't blame him, either, for wanting that release.

Many moderates and independents may still believe that at heart Romney is a moderate Republican who fortunately has no principles and will say whatever it takes to win. Actually, citizens of all stripes across the country more or less believe that Romney's been faking who he is, but it's moderates he must now convince that he's been lying like mad for the past year.

These accomplishments should not go unrecognized.”

"We've been using PPIs and H2 blockers for more than 20 years, ever since I was in medical school," says Dr. Amitabh Chak, a gastroenterologist at University Hospitals Case Medical Center. "I do think they are fairly well tolerated and fairly safe, so they're commonly prescribed."
But in his 2008 campaign and statements as president, Obama promised more than just to do better than his opponents. He cast himself as a reformer — leaving himself open to criticism from both the left and the right when he strays from the ethical high ground.
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. is playing a larger and more directly partisan role in this year's elections than it is known to have played in any previous U.S. campaign.

Back-story: After Club Fantasy closed in 1990, The Paradox became a mecca for dance music in Baltimore. Alongside Club Choices, it played a fundamental role in the evolution of B-more club music over the '90s, becoming a platform to many of the voices — K-Swift, Rod Lee, and later DJ Class — that came to define the genre, as well as Baltimore-bred house divas like Ultra Nate. In January, it closed for five weeks for a renovation.
"As long as they're sober, it can be sort of hard to get them to participate," said Duffy, who typically drinks one rum and Coke per set. ("My brothers drink enough beer for all of us.") "Once they get a few drinks in them, it doesn't take them long to catch on. All you need is one or two people to get it started."
U.S. officials said the issue could linger ahead of talks this week but suggested the deal showed that relations between Washington and Beijing had made progress. "This was not easy for the Chinese government," said one official.
The Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s office said the information in the witness statements is redundant. Prosecutors said the trial court heard evidence Brooks was acting strange. He accused his coworkers of poisoning him and made his wife test his food.
Green-band trailers, in contrast, are generally scrubbed of most offensive content and made available either for all audiences or appropriate audiences, the latter being audiences in theaters that don't contain a significant proportion of children.
Ohio is on the right track with these bills. Pension forfeiture should be the rule, not the exception, when someone who is supposed to be serving the public betrays the public instead. The public should not have to finance the retirement of an employee or officeholder guilty of malfeasance.

So yes, there is a reason that the Devils’ captain looked like the hungriest player on the ice Thursday night, throwing his body around like the season hung in the balance on every shift because, well, it did.
Nothing stopped Cardinals starting pitcher Chris Carpenter - not some stray cumulo nimbus, not a tedious 27-pitch first inning, not two difficult fly balls driven over right fielder Jon Jay, not the uncertain run support that has tracked him for much of this season.
Two decades later, Leavy, by then a sportswriter, spent a day interviewing Mantle in Atlantic City, where he was working as a casino greeter — a gig that got him temporarily banned from organized baseball. Mantle drank his way through the day, concluding in the hotel bar, where he thrust an unwanted hand at her before passing out.
Smith revised "Wealth of Nations" several times in his life and never retracted the sentiments expressed in his first work. He expected people to think of all members of society, to help them and to be other-regarding.
The announcement from Cynthia Stowe, Coast Guard captain for the Port of San Francisco, came during a conference call to announce a safety panel organized by the group U.S. Sailing to study the April 14 accident near the Farallon Islands in which five crew members died.

We will define rock ’n’ roll as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame does — basically, all popular music, from the 1950s on. We may have separate categories, as in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, for sidemen, early influences and non-performers. But we’ll also think about adding some categories.

øQB: Matthew Stafford, Lions - The last time the All-Joe team selected a player who passed for more than 5,000 yards and 40 TDs was never. Despite posting such numbers and leading Detroit into postseason for the first time this century, Stafford could not snap the Lions' 40-year streak of failing to send a quarterback to the Pro Bowl. But he'll fix that soon enough. Alex Smith, 49ers - He may never be as good as the man he was drafted way ahead of (Aaron Rodgers), but his team player longer this season largely thanks to Smith's playoff heroics. After throwing a league-low five interceptions, Smith could really blossom in 2012 while playing in the same offense in successive seasons for the first time … provided San Francisco re-signs him. Tim Tebow, Broncos - Love him or loathe the hype surrounding him, there's no denying he revitalized a team that was dead in the water into AFC West champs. We especially appreciate his willingness to play wideout when Kyle Orton was still the starter.
If companies increase hiring, that would boost incomes and give households more money to increase spending. Consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of economic activity. Weakness in spending has been a key reason the economy has been growing at sub-par rates over the past year.

Prof. Wick said there is one issue that does concern him this winter: the possibility of desiccation, or plants drying out. The higher-than-normal temperatures may cause plants to lose more moisture through evaporation. That could pose a problem for grass as well as broad-leaf evergreens such as rhododendrons.
PetroLogistics shares opened at $16.50 on NYSE, down 2.9% from its IPO price of $17.

After falling further later in the day, it pared its losses to close 2.9% lower at $16.50.
This menu takes pretension and throws it in the recycling bin. Classic recipes are lightened up just enough to adjust to contemporary palates. The only menu description that goes beyond the basics is the Joe's Italian chopped salad ($15.95): "chopped romaine & radicchio, pepperoncini, garbanzo beans, olives, cherry tomatoes, salami, provolone, fennel & Italian dressing."
Countries like Italy and Spain need help now to lower their bond yields, an interest rate that reflects the cost of their borrowing and how creditworthy they are deemed to be by investors.

A component of the plan referred to as “Opportunity New Jersey” committed Verizon to building a 100-percent broadband network by 2010 “to support data rates up to 45,000,000 bits per second and higher,” BPU’s order to show cause asserts. This transmission capability “enables services, for example, that will allow residential and business customers to receive high definition video and to send and receive interactive video signals” — services residents of Greenwich and Stow Creek townships asserted in February they are not receiving.

Bruce Nauman's film and video pieces at Reed College's Cooley Gallery. Much of the earliest work by American artist Bruce Nauman is marked by a less-is-more aesthetic, in which austerely minimal sculptures, photographs and environments investigate sweeping existential quandaries -- from fear of failure to basic phenomenal inquiries -- with unusual precision.
The largest U.S. note currently in wide circulation is a $100 bill. But police found bundles of $1 million, $100,000 and $500 notes in the man's hotel room in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday, said Izany Abdul Ghany, head of the city's commercial crime unit.
Archibald said the policy change was motivated in part by discussions about whether area residents who don't live in the zoo-museum district should be allowed free general admission to four of its five institutions. Two years ago, then-state Sen. Joan Bray proposed changing Missouri law to let the institutions charge visitors who don't pay the property tax. The zoo and art museum opposed the change, and the bill went nowhere.
"Our defense played great," Teeters said. "I can't remember how long they had the ball at the end of the game, but it felt like forever and my defense did a great job keeping them out. They got an 8-meter in there, and I just saw the ball and went for it and cleared it out."

The council recognized TWM for its cutting-edge 3D laser scanning of the interior of the former Valmeyer limestone mine, now known as Rock City Business Complex. TWM used 3D scanning technology to map and model the mine's surfaces for the 75,000-square-foot National Archives Annex II. The highly accurate data collected during this process was used to create a 3D model of the space. Designers could then configure the space in the most efficient manner possible for National Archives storage.

Had Mattingly played on better Yankee teams, I think he would be getting more Hall of Fame consideration. I feel this way because Mattingly's career numbers are nearly identical to those of the late Kirby Puckett, who was enshrined in Cooperstown in 2001, which was his first year on the ballot.
Stockton, Calif., had the highest overall percentage of foreclosures in the country, with its one-in-60 rate more than three times the national average. But the 3,912 properties that had foreclosure filings in the area represent a 13% drop from the fourth quarter and 19% slide year-over-year.

While revealing weaknesses and the key contributions of lenders, the East Wing also clearly shows how the museum has been playing catch-up in recent decades, often with great success.
Answer: I think the significant part about what Secretary Gates has put on the table and what we have executed is not necessarily a cut of the defense budget but rather taking a look at our budget and then challenging the services to reinvest or realign. I welcome that. And for the Navy it's important because we're heavily involved ashore in the Middle East, in Iraq, Afghanistan. We have 14,500 sailors ashore, more than the about 10,000 we have at sea. Many of those sailors ashore come from San Diego and commands around San Diego. That's about the same amount of sailors that we have committed to the fight as the Marine Corps has committed to the fight. That said, we still believe that because of our global interests, the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean/Arabian Gulf region require continued attention and continued presence and that we in the Navy are the force that best provides that presence and that attention. And we've stayed true to that even as we're dealing with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And what we have been able to do is to take that opportunity for realignment and reinvestment and address some of the structure issues and capability issues that allow us to, I think, better provide that presence and better provide the nation with options in those important parts of the world.
Same-sex relationships exist. Parents already have to navigate conversations about Johnny's two dads and why two women live together next door or why two men are holding hands at the market. The conversations can be just as awkward as explaining why Macy doesn't live with both her parents anymore, and why Macy and her mom are no longer free for play dates because her mom has to work more now that her dad has left. And parents are grappling with decisions about sleepovers between their high school daughter and their daughter's lesbian friend.
CENTURY CITY -- Los Angeles County voters gave strong support Tuesday to a proposed half-cent sales tax that would fund a myriad of public transportation projects, but the measure was falling just shy of the two-thirds majority vote it needs to win approval, according to early election returns.

As physicians in training, we see contraception as an essential component of effective primary care, not as a political line item in Washington or the Vatican. Just as we provide tetanus shots and Pap smears, we prescribe contraception to maintain the well-being of our patients. Universal contraceptive access is a matter of reproductive justice and a major determinant of whether both men and women have control over their own futures, regardless of socioeconomic status.
"This type of behavior has always existed, but it seems like it's … becoming more of a problem," Davitt said. "We certainly respect the First Amendment, but the courts have made clear … that the First Amendment does not protect fraudulent speech. Clearly that was the case here. It wasn't just political speech. It was fraudulent speech."
The latest edition of Baseball America paints a devastating picture of the Sox' lack of commitment to the international market (especially when compared to the Rangers). How long, realistically, will it take for the team to close the gap? It's an important question given the obvious lack of talent on the major league roster. Michael Peregrine, Glencoe

øSince not all student loans participate in IBR or loan forgiveness, you could certainly ask your lender about a graduated payment. Graduated payments result in a lower payment for a pre-determined amount of time, but the payments will eventually increase. This could make sense if you felt something will change in your financial situation. Make sure to ask the lender in advance what your payment will be when it increases, because it will be necessary to have the income to meet this payment further down the road.

It's good that Ann Romney had choices. She made them honorably and raised a great family. Now let's debate what should matter in a presidential campaign: Which policies will relieve the economic pressures on millions of parents who are equally determined to do right by their kids but have far less room for maneuver. Pro-family rhetoric doesn't pay the bills.

TAMPA — Cilantro is the most divisive herb. Some people can't even be in the same room with it, can detect a single quark of the green herb in a bathtub of salsa.

The Fiesta Bowl would be fine not hosting a bowl in certain years, if it can host a playoff game. On the other hand, the Rose Bowl would prefer to just be the Rose Bowl, sticking with its traditional matchup of Big Ten champion vs. Pac-12 champion on New Year's Day.

There are options: Put the car in neutral, or in park, or switch off the ignition. But experts say those choices would be almost impossible for most drivers to consider when they're in a panic, because frightened people often can't remember even simple steps to protect themselves. That -- coupled with increasingly complicated gadgetry -- makes cars a dangerous place to be when you're facing an unexpected situation.

I remember that Jesus took a moment to sit with a woman at a well, and that pointed her toward living water. In her excitement, she ran and told all people about the one she had met. I imagine she was filled with gratitude.

In a 2003 Field Poll, 35 percent of voters said eating habits and exercise were the top threats to children's health.

Even if Tebow sells a few thousand PSLs, even if he gets the Jets the coveted Back Page every now and then in a town where the Super Bowl Giants reside, even if he is able to add toughness and leadership and class to a locker room sorely lacking them, was it worth bringing in a Wildcat quarterback/special teamer/jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none who will draw media crowds worthy of a rock star everywhere he walks (on water)? No.

By last season it was clear that Third Rail was outgrowing its home at North Portland's Interstate Firehouse Cultural Center. When the center's available dates for this season didn't match the company's needs, Third Rail decided to head downtown. The move provides about twice as many seats (220 as it's set up for "Dead Funny") and a nicer-looking facility. A few days ago the 700th season subscriber signed on, up from 535 at the end of the '07-'08 season. The company's budget has jumped from $202,000 to $350,000, thanks in part to grants from the Meyer Memorial Trust and the Miller Foundation to help with the move and to pay for administrative work.

It's a telling image, at once fanciful and suggestive. That lightness of being which Max experiences on a personal level was felt more widely, for example, by thousands of immigrants whose records were destroyed by the quake and fire.

Legislatures, facing large deficits and lagging tax receipts, have been slicing education budgets. Politicians, especially on the right, have attacked teachers unions as the problem with public education, rather than engaging them as critical allies for change. So-called education reformers have focused heavily on using student test scores to evaluate teachers (while others complain that teachers are “teaching to the test”). Meanwhile, little effort is made to address the strong correlation between socio-economic status and student achievement in the U.S.

If Congress fails to extend the current payroll tax cut, taxes will go up on millions of people at a time when families are struggling to make ends meet. That's unacceptable, as a typical household earning $50,000 a year will see their taxes increase by $1,000. But if Congress passes the proposal laid out by President Obama, the typical family earning $50,000 a year would see that tax cut continued, and receive more than $500 additionally — for a total tax cut of $1,500. It makes absolutely no sense to raise taxes on the middle class at a time when so many are still trying to get back on their feet and we see positive signs in growth and falling unemployment.

But the 2.8 percent annualized growth rate in the October-December quarter -- the fastest pace since the spring of 2010 -- isn't being cheered by most economists or investors. That's because growth would need to be much stronger to sharply reduce unemployment. And signs in the data point to slower growth ahead.

--Once again, the Kings won the special-teams battle via unconventional methods. The Kings went 0-for-6 on the power play and 9-for-9 on the penalty kill, and got a huge first-period shorthanded goal from Anze Kopitar. The Kings have neither scored nor allowed a power-play goal in this series, but they are focused on improving the power play, particularly the shot totals. "We're getting some wristers through, but I think we need to be getting a lot more shots than we have been," defenseman Drew Doughty said. "Our power play has been struggling.

Over the past 10 years, increased standardized testing and harsher penalties for a growing number of schools have led to frustration and public resentment about federal public education policy. Hence we are cheered by the U.S. Department of Education's recent decision to offer more flexible and reasonable options for demonstrating progress on improving student achievement.

But the candidate did not unveil any new policy proposals tailored to women. Instead, speaking at several women-owned businesses with scores of women behind him as a backdrop, Romney hit many of the same themes that he has been for months: what he views as Obama's ineffectual $787-billion government stimulus program, financial regulations that he says have slowed lending and business growth, and a burgeoning deficit that he says has made it difficult for the economy to recover.

Tóibín is strong at depicting the way restrained passion works. But leaving Enniscorthy has not allowed Eilis to be suddenly transformed into a woman fully in touch with her feelings or capable of expressing them. She moves more slowly than Tony, and intimacy is strange territory for her, but she seems almost ready to let go, breaking the grip of her past, when she is summoned back to Enniscorthy.

This practice creates a closed-loop system the heart of sustainable practice. Thanks to students' hard work, vegetables grown from the community garden are harvested for the cafeteria and the Oregon Food Bank.

Phillips’ valves are damaged, but just a little. She won’t need surgery.
Not to mention run support for guys such as Chris Volstad (0-3), who nursed a 1-1 game into the sixth inning before allowing a run-scoring double to Carlos Beltran, followed by a two-run home run to David Freese.

The GOP bill would repeal a preventive care program created under President Barack Obama's health care overhaul law of 2010. Picking up on a theme that House Democrats have been sounding this week, the White House said that "women in particular" benefit from the program -- a message that reflects the Democratic effort to woo women voters by accusing Republicans of waging a war on them.

That the corps is open to releasing more water from upstream reservoirs earlier in the season is no whole solution, of course. In this year's flood, for instance, releasing water earlier might have aggravated the corps' flood fight on the Mississippi River in the spring. The Mississippi already was so high that the corps
Newhouse and Roghan had been in the area on a contract painting job, police said. It is unclear why they fled. The driver and passenger in the SUV were not charged.
Jasper's Corner Tap & Kitchen, on its nondescript edge of the Tenderloin's lodging zone, seems on quick glance to be another by-numbers hotel effort. Yet here's a confluence of Bar Stars: Kevin Diedrich, whose work at the Burritt Room caught our attention last year, and Brian MacGregor, whose concoctions at Jardiniere earned him the honor in 2010. When I walked in on a recent night, both were working - a critical mass of cocktail talent.

"It should be pointed out that in the last election when we had to ratify the defining document of this city for the next 10, 15, 20 years, only 10% of the city voted," he said, referring to November's city charter vote.

We can have rallies and throw our fists in the air, but until the people of Detroit go out and vote, we nullify democracy arguments."
Dear K.A.: Hang your leather pants in a cool closet, but do not cover them with a plastic bag, as leather must breathe or it will become dry and brittle. Try to avoid having your pants dry-cleaned as long as possible, and then take them only to a leather specialist. The solvents used in regular dry cleaning will cause the leather to stiffen and lose its luster. For surface soil, smooth leather can be wiped with a damp cloth. For a list of dry cleaners specializing in leather, go to leatherusa.com, the website for Leather Industries of America.

øUnfortunately, my Vikings have gotten off to a tough start this season, so maybe we can get Minnesota vibes heading in the right direction. The Vikings have always been a passion for me. I've loved them since I was probably in kindergarten. I remember as a kid following them in the Sunday paper, reading all the articles.

Looking over that list, it's clear that there are few consensus players who emerge as the clear choice for any defensive awards. Buehrle, the St. Charles native, is one. Gardner sure appears like he should get some run as the best defensive left fielder -- which is a little like saying the left fielder who should be playing center. Jackson stands out as perhaps the best center fielder in the majors. (Aside: Bourjos was second in the majors to Jackson with a plus-24.)

"Until recently, the auto rental industry has been reactive in fighting these excise taxes," explains Chris Brown, executive editor of Auto Rental News, a trade publication.

A detail. What does "Redemption" mean in the title? Who, or what, is redeemed, and how? If you kill lots of people and are still alive, have you been redeemed? If you and your brother don't kill each other after almost everyone else does, is that redemption? Or is "redemption" just one of those title words like "reloaded" or "destiny" to help people tell movies apart?

ø- Like Plural Eyes, Apple wants to sync up the various cameras (you can use up to 9 cameras) by using the audio to line them up. But what if, say, you have great sound on camera #1, but the other cameras are using the natural sound provided by their internal (and usually very lousy) microphones? If so, you don't do as well. You will need to put a microphone - a shotgun, a lavalier - anything, to help each camera record sound if you want Apple's Multicamera option to perform at its best.
The turn brought the As, which ostensibly was the exact card Gagne was looking for. But an ace was probably the only card that would cause her to lose her stack, since her freshly made straight was inferior to Juttelstad's. Not surprisingly, turning the straight inspired Gagne to move all in, leading to an instant call from Juttelstad that would make him the champion after the river came 8s. Gagne was doomed when the ace hit the board, and the only real strategic question is what's the best method of getting her money in. (Some would say she should check and give Juttelstad an opportunity to bluff, since he is almost never calling an all-in with a worse hand.)
He added that it would take 2½ years to build the pipeline, which so far, he said, Toyota Tsusho, Oil & Natural Gas Corp., China National Petroleum Corp. and Malaysian state-owned oil company Petroliam Nasional Bhd. had shown interest in bidding to finance.

The Muslim Public Affairs Council, a Los Angeles-based advocacy group, blames bigotry on "a small cottage industry" that foments prejudice on the Web and elsewhere.

Friday's development came as the Vikings continued to plead their case for a new 65,000-seat stadium in Arden Hills, in Ramsey County. As the Legislature met during the midafternoon, Lester Bagley, the Vikings' vice president for stadium development and public affairs, huddled with some of the team's nine lobbyists just outside the Senate's main door. Afterward Cory Merrifield, the co-founder of SavetheVikes, a pro-stadium fan group, stopped senators as they left the chamber.

Meet the new face of the food cart revolution: Roving gastro-trucks that mash up ethnic cuisines, pop culture and affordability, then post their ever-shifting locations to a wired clientele through Twitter and Web sites. In Portland that means Koi Fusion, which launched in June when business grad Bo Kwon hit the streets in an $80,000 food truck with a spicy mix of Korean barbecue tacos, kimchi quesadillas and Korean fries. Now Kwon draws followers on the command of a tweet -- often to PGE Park or PSU but also renegade spots. And wherever Koi lands, the feel is of an instant party, fed by a communal condiment station and a great playlist. (Watch video here.)
It's long gone now, but 100 years ago today the Tigers moved into their new home at the corner of Michigan and Trumbull.
Gavin's chosen Billy Joel's "New York State of Mind" for their rumba because a Billy Joel concert inspired him to be a musician. Gavin moved to New York in 1998 to start his career and he gets a little emotional talking about how supportive his family was. The hat is off! A whole family of sparrows has had to relocate! OK, the hat's back on for the performance, which Gavin starts at the piano, miming playing the intro. Something about the cut of the line around the bottom of Karina's body suit is giving it a rather unfortunate "diaper cover" feel. Aw, Gavin's family is in the audience and looks fit to burst with pride. Bruno likes Gavin's hip action but tells him to work on his turns. Carrie Ann's heart is racing because it's gone all fluttery for Gavin. She says he has an "authentic attention to detail." She's got "Gavin Fever!" Len says that the slow dance shows every detail and he saw good hips, musicality and no problem with the turns. He adds that Gavin's showing great progression as a dancer. Gavin starts to cry when Brooke asks him about his family being there tonight.

It was just fun hanging out with people I hadn't met before, and this guy at the time, I really liked him." Worst date: "It was a DJ. I called and requested a song, and he turned out to be this really cool guy. We talked on the phone for a long time, so I agreed to come to his studio and meet him. ... It was uncomfortable for everybody that was there. I was like, why did I do this? He wasn't the person I met on the phone. He acted like he had to prove something to me." What she's looking for: A tall, funny, athletic, attractive, spontaneous guy who will dance with her and knows what he wants and goes after it. What friends say: "Guys see that she's a Chiefs cheerleader, so they have this assumption she's going to be ditsy. Then they see she went to law school, so she'll be intelligent and quiet. Then she starts getting all crazy and goofy. ... I think guys are just like, whoa, I have three different girlfriends at one time." -Tonya Ware Last words: "I hate those games where he has to wait three days to call me. If you like me, let me know, so I don't have to sit there and figure it out. ... When I first go out with a guy, if he doesn't already know I'm a cheerleader, I don't let him know until I feel there's a connection. ... Sometimes I feel like, if I like this guy, I'm going to have to be the one to call him. I like guys who take initiative." * The Chiefs don't release the last names of their cheerleaders.

The upheaval of today's Middle East is surely comparable to the disorder in Europe that followed the French revolution and, under Napoleon's banner, spread military turmoil across the continent. The Middle East still hasn't absorbed the Iranian revolution of 1979, let alone the Arab Spring that is shaking the Sunni world. It's a region begging for a new concert of nations that accommodates conservative monarchies and new republics.

Smith: In the previous question, you said the arts is a real important part of the economy so how should we promote cultural tourism. I actually don't think the most important element of the arts in our economy is tourism. I think the most important element are things harder to calculate. It's not by accident that Wieden + Kennedy is in the Pearl District.

My hunch is, the most important element of our, of why the arts is crucial to the local economy is that it helps our workers, our people, solve problems and think about the world differently. Whether it's advertising or clean tech, we can compete in the global knowledge economy better.

Even users of the word look down their noses at some bespoke brethren. Stefan Paszke, one of the owners of Bespoke Cycles in San Francisco, says some companies tweak an off-the-shelf bicycle frame and unfairly call it custom. "That's not really a bespoke bike," he says.

A fountain might sound like a surprising addition when you're thinking water conservation, but even though recirculating fountains lose some water to evaporation and splash-out - the East Bay Municipal Utility District estimates that about 1 to 4 gallons per square foot of water per year gets lost to evaporation from pools - it still uses a lot less than the water lost to a large turf grass lawn, and the pleasure that people take in the sound of water can be well worth the trade-off.

The EPA asked the Fisheries Service to assess 37 pesticides, herbicides and fungicides for possible harm to fish. Today's ruling involved the first three. Rulings on the rest will come during the next 3 1/2 years.
"The criminal-justice process many times can victimize a victim all over again," Morris County Prosecutor Robert Bianchi told the crowd. He noted that prosecutors' offices used to have very little contact with a victim's family, in terms of informing them about the judicial steps in the process or preparing them about what to expect. The victim-witness units filled that void. "What a change has occurred from what it was 25 years ago."

In fact, there's nothing peaceful in a jump from the bridge. Once a person dives, depending on where he or she jumps, the body plummets 240 to 250 feet in four seconds, traveling about 75 mph, and hits the water with the force of a speeding truck meeting a concrete building. Some die instantly from extensive internal injuries; others drown in their own blood.

Haridopolos, the flip side. Here's the good news on our Brevard County legislator: He's one of the few leaders standing tall when it comes to pill mills. While Gov. Rick Scott wants to get rid of a database for heavy users of prescription drugs — something that has broad bipartisan support from politicians and law enforcement — Haridopolos is standing firm. "We have no interest whatsoever of scrapping that database," he said in a recent story by the News Service of Florida. "I strongly believe that we have to get a handle on this." Haridopolos is right. That doctors in Florida prescribe more oxycodone than doctors in the other 49 states combined is appalling. So, good for Haridopolos for having such backbone. Heck, more backbone and fewer book deals, Senator, and this may be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

Gingrich thrived for a while in January. His candor won him supporters in the seemingly endless string of Republican debates. But his ex-wife Marianne said Gingrich had offered her a choice of an open marriage or a divorce, and at a debate two days before South Carolina's Jan. 21 primary, CNN's John King asked Gingrich about the report. The question, the candidate snarled, was "as close to despicable as anything I can imagine." The audience applauded loudly, and Gingrich won the state's primary.

The project is in an area where state and federal scientists are studying elevated wintertime air pollution, which has at times increased ozone levels to nearly double the limit considered safe by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The next day I went to a home store. I bought bags of fertilizer and a spreader. When I got home, I suited up and declared war on my weeds. A few days after applying the fertilizer, I noticed something: stripes were appearing in neat rows across our front yard. They looked like lanes for sprinters. The kids giggled every time they walked in the house. In the war against weeds, I had lost the first skirmish.
What followed was a heightening of this ethos: Aldo Leopold helped champion the emerging field of ecology; a 1964 federal Wilderness Act protected 9.1 million acres in 54 parks (now 110 million acres over 757 sites); and the first Earth Day arrived, even as it oddly supplanted the April 22 celebration of Arbor Day in many states.

I love the way the president went all the way to Afghanistan to tell us that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. He was referring to the end of the long, drawn-out decade of war.
And now there's even an app for doing our taxes. TurboTax for iPhone and Android not only lets you fill out the return, but uses the phone's camera to snap a photo of your W2s to record the data. And speaking of money, my camera-equipped smartphone has relieved me of the one reason I used to have to visit my local bank. Now, instead of driving to a branch, I use the bank's app to take a picture of checks that I'm sent and "phone in" my deposits.
It’s a red-meat moment for Red Staters – the visual equivalent of that infamous “You lie!” shout from a congressman at Obama’s health care address in 2009. For those who despise Obama, Brewer is putting that “dictatorial-socialist-Kenyan-born” president in his place. You can be sure Brewer will use the photo in her fundraising and campaign literature.

Like glasses or orthodontics, "whatever it is, you fix it," Tammy says. Even if it is more complicated than eye charts, or braces, which Max has needed, twice. She is nervous about Max's surgery, because there are risks with any surgery. But she knows that if he should ever change his mind -- though she doesn't think he will -- it is reversible. And the only other path -- forcing Max to continue being a brutally unhappy Makenzie -- wasn't an option at all.

I think Samardzija was just trying to be honest, and he subsequently admitted he talked a big game about being a starter and didn't want to "look like an idiot." I'd rather a player say something interesting than repeat the old company line of "whatever is best for the team." As far as hubris consultant, I believe that's part of the psychologist's job. And he's doing a great job, by the way.
Driving around this area can be confusing, so take along a local map. You can use it to chart out the same two-day itinerary I followed during a trip earlier this year.
They have reacted, however, in what I can only assume are hostile ways. One night, we found a giant bullfrog (dead) in my office. Wilbur subsequently waddled in with a mole in his mouth (also dead). Previously, we had only been given mice as presents. Now they seem to be moving on to bigger things. We hope these are not subtle messages.

With Bannan aboard, the Broncos possess enough defensive tackles to make it through a game, with Mitch Unrein seeing spot duty and defensive end Robert Ayers rotating inside on pass-rush downs when linebacker Von Miller moves to defensive end. The position isn't settled by any means, but it allows the Broncos draft-day flexibility to pick the best player available, not necessarily a defensive tackle if a coveted prospect drops.

Speaking of showing up, lots of Ducks fans at Staples Center on Sunday. Plenty of Blazers fans, too. Felt like a neutral-site game at times. Maybe they'd all been sucked in by the 3-0 start. Maybe they were just looking for something to do on the eve of the Rose Bowl. No doubt, what anyone who saw the game was served was a reminder that one furious quarter almost never erases three panicked ones.
Investigators couldn't determine the date of the First Thursday event. Breedlove had previously said it was June 2, 2005. But Adams was out of town that week, the report said. Adams and Breedlove agree they most likely met at the May 5 First Thursday.
There's a frothy unreality to all this, from the gorgeous house they stay in to their staggering collection of high heels and designer short skirts. The movie makes no effort to explain why or how seemingly shallow and self-absorbed Kim came to carry this pregnancy to term.

Seau, a 12-time NFL Pro Bowler, had struggled to adapt to life after a 20-year professional football career. He drove his SUV off an embankment in October 2010 after being arrested on suspicion of domestic assault.

"If Energizer Holdings were a dog sled team, we'd be questioning whether some of the dogs should be cut loose," Morningstar analyst Lauren DeSanto wrote in a research note last month, referring to Energizer's battery business as one lacking "decent growth opportunities."
"You feel all the aches and pains, the recovery time doubles. I'm still learning how to adapt. It is tough training every day, but I love it. I miss diving when I'm not doing it, but there are times I force myself to take a break and rest because there's always a point of diminishing returns."

Security procedures at U.S. airports were unchanged despite the plot, a reflection of both the U.S. confidence in its security systems and a recognition that the government can't realistically expect travelers to endure much more. Increased costs and delays to airlines and shipping companies from new security measures could have a global economic impact too.
Makenna Reeves, a senior at Principia College in Elsah, Ill., said she was on the team that helped build the solar car, which is named Ra 6 for the Egyptian sun god.
Filling out this volume, and taking up more space than the verse, is extended commentary on the poems by Burnett, a professor of English at Boston University and editor of the Oxford editions of A.E. Housman's poems and letters. Burnett's tireless tracking down of bits and pieces of Larkin's work and his erudite annotations are an impressive act of scholarship. But while this volume certainly belongs in university libraries -- providing an amazingly detailed map of Larkin's development as an artist -- it will strike nonacademic readers as a form of overkill. Most readers will be far happier with "Collected Poems," edited by Anthony Thwaite, or a collection selected by Martin Amis.

Flip through the issues that Whedon has written or overseen, and his familiar, slangy sound comes through: Buffy, preparing to battle demons, marshals her troops. But first: "Did you bring any lip gloss? I'm all cracky." Or, Buffy, fighting her fears: "It's good. It's good. I'm spine." Or, Buffy facing down a "Big Bad," as Whedon's villains are called: "This isn't about demons at all, is it?...It's about power and it's about women and you just hate those two words in the same sentence, don't you?"

A few days before the GLVC tournament, Hogg was named to a first-team position on the all-GLVC team. He followed that up with an all-GLVC tournament selection after averaging 19.3 points per game during Southern Indiana's four victories. Three times in those games Hogg scored 20 or more points, including 20 in a 71-68 semifinal victory over Bellarmine (Ky.) University, the nation's No. 1-ranked Division II team. Southern Indiana knocked off 10th-ranked Northern Kentucky, which will soon be a Division I team, 60-56 in the title game.

At the time, the Spanish government was running a surplus and its public finances were healthy. Then, the construction bubble burst and this nation of 47 million was plunged into crisis. Today, unemployment is more than 24 percent, the highest in the Euro zone, and for people under 25 it's at a staggering 50 percent. Economists say the base figure could rise to 30 percent.

Charles Brown, North Carolina, CB: At 5-foot-9 and 210 pounds, Brown lacks the ideal size for a cornerback, but he possesses enough traits where scouts feel he has a good chance to catch on with an NFL team as a nickel back. Brown, who started 12 games for the Tarheels last season, is tough and competitive, loves to hit and support the run and has good ball skills, evidenced by his eight career interceptions. The Ravens are stocked with young cornerbacks, but Brown’s ability to return kickoffs and punts gives him an extra dimension.
BEND -- April was the worst month for foreclosures in the history of Deschutes County, but observers say the surge is a result of banks and mortgage service companies clearing out a backlog.
Love: In the meantime, "Good Vibrations" was our answer to that psychedelic era, to what was going on at the time. It's our most successful, unique song that we've ever done. Brian did an amazing job on it with the structure of the track, with the harmonies. I collaborated by writing the lyrics, "I'm picking up good vibrations." It was so unique in its use of the theremin. In fact, Rolling Stone said it was the single of the century.
"Over the last three years, the tide has turned," he declared. "We broke the Taliban's momentum. We've built strong Afghan security forces. We devastated al-Qaida's leadership, taking out over 20 of their top 30 leaders. And one year ago, from a base here in Afghanistan, our troops launched the operation that killed Osama bin Laden. The goal that I set - to defeat al-Qaida, and deny it a chance to rebuild - is within reach."
Healthier snacking: Natural products manufacturers want a piece of the grazing market.

The legislation, which also seeks to head off an automatic cut in Medicare reimbursements to doctors, is less generous than a version that Obama and congressional Democrats have championed. The newer measure would be financed by cutting federal workforce salaries, requiring higher earning elderly people to pay more for Medicare and raising some federal fees. But it ignores the higher taxes on the rich that Democrats would use to cover the costs of their proposal.

Khodorkovsky's sentence is due to expire in a year, just before Russia's 2012 presidential election. So new charges were brought against him, contradicting the first. Now it is said that he stole from his company the same oil that it was previously accused of not paying taxes on. Putin's own former prime minister testified that the allegations were "absurd." No matter. Prosecutors blackmailed the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers into withdrawing an exculpatory audit. They tortured and intimidated would-be witnesses, offering an imprisoned former Yukos executive treatment for AIDS in exchange for false testimony.

In 2010 when his hands, arms and legs were going numb and he was not able to use them much, he had an MRI and discovered a tumor inside his spinal cord which required life threatening surgery. His chances for being a quadriplegic were very great. With his abilities on the computer he found the National Institute of Research Center in Bethesda, MD which accepted him immediately. He had Spiringomylea which effect 1 in 100,000. They immediately flew him and his wife to Maryland for surgery. By God’s grace he was not paralyzed as Springfield doctors had said he would be. He had physical therapy in Springfield and thanks be to God he began to be able to walk and was beginning to have feeling in his arms again. His hands were still drawn and he was not able to do a lot of things but he kept working to try and get better. During this time he started an online college course in web design with Rasmussan College.

Clooney wisely recognized that the triggering action of Willimon's play involving a clandestine meeting wasn't large enough for a big-screen narrative. (Truth be told, the trust-breaking event wasn't substantial enough for the stage either, but in the theater, the piece found momentum through its Machiavellian banter.) The solution to a problematic plot, however, isn't more plot. Clooney and his fellow writers keep adding to the store of incidents in an attempt to magnify Gosling's character's interior journey when they should have reworked the story from scratch. The result is a polished piece of filmmaking that's marred by the unshapliness of its morality tale.
The Cardinals have options available to handle first base. Filling in during the four games Berkman missed to rest the injury, Matt Carpenter went eight for 16 with four extra-base hits and seven RBIs, including five in the game Sunday. Daniel Descalso also has played first in the majors.

As Cooper tells it, he first tasted mezcal in the 1970s while road-tripping through Mexico. On return trips to Oaxaca, where most mezcal is made, he sought out palenqueros, or mezcal makers, and collected rare bottles. But the spirit he loved was hard to come by in the U.S., so he started Del Maguey in 1995 to import it.

This so-called "war" hasn't affected me one bit.
Ronald K. Brown's "Espíritu Vivo" is grave and more subdued. Yet this dance, too, is masterfully built with widely spaced patterns that only gradually reveal themselves, and stunning diagonal layers moving in counterpoint. Subtlety and simplicity are among Brown's virtues; along with the way, he creates a community of independent souls giving each dancer an internal light. Susana Baca makes a guest appearance, accompanying the piece with her musicians, and the dancers acknowledge her from the stage.
Q. You have a very serious theater background, but your TV and film choices are much more diverse. Why is that?
My schedule, too, is set to music.

I chose Galvaude, with peas and shredded turkey, and was stuffed two-thirds of the way through.

Tebow is reason No. 1 why the Broncos went from 1-4 to the playoffs last season. The primary reason he became the biggest story in sports was not his strong faith or All-American persona or Gladiator style of play, although they were factors. The No. 1 reason Tebow so fascinated the nation — particular the demographic that doesn't ordinarily give a flip about football — is because he won.

We had planned to meet up at his friend's ranch, though this description is, again, fairly loose, there not being any cattle or cowboys in evidence. The term "planned" may also not be entirely accurate as there had been several versions of suggested itineraries and I was a bit vague about which one I had agreed to. I need not have worried, as a completely new version emerged during the first few rounds of complimentary margaritas that evening. We abandoned the hiring of a local Tarahumara Indian guide and pack animals in favor of "traveling light." I remember requesting the rental of a sleeping bag and tent, but this also seemed to be off the agenda.

Diamond cast Isaacs' prosecution, which was initiated under a Bush administration task force on obscenity and tried by attorneys flown in from Washington D.C., as an attack on Southern California's liberal and progressive leanings.
His claim for presidential apologies, however, is at odds with Obama's actual statements. We read through Obama's speeches and public remarks while traveling abroad but could not find a statement that included the words "sorry" or "apologize." Instead, Obama's remarks contained some criticism of past U.S. actions, but those passages were typically balanced by praise for American ideals, and Obama mentioned how other countries have erred as well. We've rated Romney's statement Pants on Fire.

Role: The former No. 1 overall draft pick will start the season exactly as he has lingered most of this professional career -- injured. Oden, who has played in just 82 games since being drafted in 2007, is unsure when he will return to the court as he continues to rehab from December knee surgery. When healthy, Oden is a potential difference-maker who can wreak havoc on defense and provide a needed post threat on offense. But his health remains a big if, and he is arguably the biggest question mark entering the season.

However, an Iranian bomb is not just a threat to Israel. It could destabilize the entire region and lead to a new arms race, and that's not in the best interests of the United States, Europe, Russia, China or anyone else. On this point, there's no daylight between the Obama and Netanyahu governments, nor is there any disagreement that it is unlikely that a nuclear-armed Iran could be contained through a traditional policy of deterrence.

Increases in salaries and benefits added $1.7 million in expenditures, Orr said. Of this, $300,000 comes from sick leave reimbursement. When employees retire they can choose to receive accumulated sick leave pay as a lump sum at the end of their final year, or they can spread the payments throughout the year. If they choose a lump sum, the payment would come out of the district's 2012-13 budget. But an increased number have chosen to spread out the payments this year, increasing the district's 2011-12 expenses, Orr said.

An occasionally by-the-numbers, often moving documentary about the Youth America Grand Prix, a U.S. ballerina competition, "First Position" stirs memories of the spelling-bee doc "Spellbound." The young subjects compete for scholarships and potential careers, and in several instances, the journey they've traveled is evident in their drive. Their devotion to their art is admirable, and the film gets under the skin, if never really in our blood.

For the first time in Bravo history, the ‘friend’ who goes to an event with the Housewife does not stir up trouble! This leads me to believe that Shannon is the only person in tonight’s episode that I would count on in an emergency situation.

Trumbo, who led the team in home runs (29) and runs batted in (87) as a rookie last season, was pushed off first by Albert Pujols, but his potent bat may force Scioscia to find more playing time for him at third, first, designated hitter and right field.

Denise also shared with me that she is more careful now about whom she invests time in. While she kept the circle of those who knew about her husband's affair small (wise girl), she saw some friends treat her marriage like something to be thrown away.

The actors do a lot with their small roles, briefly cutting through the movie's off-putting vision of the future (think "The Fifth Element," only gaudier). Their performances are the only things in the film that don't feel processed and sterilized and safe. With this cautiously violent parable, Ross is so mindful of not upsetting his target audience (or earning the wrath of their parents) that he ends up patronizing them instead: This is the mildest, shallowest variation on "The Most Dangerous Game" ever filmed, with the worst closing shot ever to grace the first installment in an intended franchise.

Obama also mentioned he might enjoy a shave ice, Hawaii's lighter-flaked snow cone with a rainbow of tropical flavors and toppings to choose from. The local buzz predicted he would favor the original Waiola Bakery and Shave Ice at 2135 Waiola St., which is near Obama's boyhood haunts, or the newer location at 525 Kapahulu Ave., which isn't that far away. But my guess is that with two young daughters and a secluded beach in Kailua at his disposal, the senator might have opted for something closer, like Island Snow in Kailua Beach Center.

About one-third of the menu changes every day, keeping palates and ideas fresh.
After Vice Mayor Madison Nguyen made the initial motion to approve the measure, Councilman Pete Constant followed with a substitute motion that tightened some language and added a request from Councilman Sam Liccardo aimed at thwarting union legal challenges. That move blocked any other potential substitute motions by Councilmen Ash Kalra, Kansan Chu and Don Rocha, all of whom suggested alternatives during the three-hour meeting. Kalra and Chu ultimately joined Xavier Campos in opposing the measure. But Rocha, a swing vote, noted the effectiveness of the parliamentary maneuver as he sought in vain to modify the measure and realized his only option was begging Constant to allow "friendly amendments." Constant's reply: "No," "Hell no," and "I'm not entertaining any friendly amendments."

Size matters. You'll need to know the height and width of the space the bookcase will go into, making allowances for locations near radiators, heating vents, doors and windows, and under wall lighting.

As time goes on, memories fade, people die, records are lost,” Brannigan said. “From a legal perspective, the statutes exist to assure that there is fairness in the judicial process and that there are speedy trials. This bill will not protect a single child. This is backward-looking, not forward-looking.”

Kitzhaber decided he couldn't do that, writing, "The single-best indicator of who will and will not be executed has nothing to do with the circumstances of a crime or the findings of a jury.

While this evidence could certainly lead a rational fact finder to conclude that 'something fishy' was going on, it does not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendants reached a concrete agreement to forcibly oppose the U.S. government. ..."

In another game, Greer noticed that one team was doubling LaMarcus Aldridge in a way that left Miller wide open in the corner. Greer suggested an offensive tweak that shifted Miller to the weakside and Nicolas Batum -- a much better three-point shooter -- to the opening in the corner.
Villa Duchesne (6-2, No. 2 small schools) is another team which could made a deep run into the tournament, along with Rosati-Kain (4-0, No. 6 small schools) and Ursuline (4-1). Lee's Summit and Jackson are out-state schools that are dangerous, too.
While Lugar says the Keystone pipeline will lower gas prices, his opponents charge him with wanting to raise prices through higher gas taxes.
"We couldn't let (Rose) get his game going, because he sets the tone for that team," Smart said. "You can't stop Derrick Rose one-on-one, but our entire team did an excellent job against him."
Next June, Patty Cahill will mark 25 years at Kansas City's public broadcaster KCUR-FM, many of those as its general manager. Not only is that a nice endpoint for her career, the quarter-century of service qualifies her for early retirement from the University of Missouri-Kansas City. So, why not?
Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-high, heat the oil. Add the mushrooms, onion and garlic and saute until the mushrooms are browned and any liquid that was released has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Stir in the cream, scraping the bottom of the pan.

"He's been missing for so long. How do you hide out from 350 million people?" Goodman said. "I thought they were going to find them dead -- the girls and him -- so I am very, very relieved that those girls are home and they're not dead, like I figured they were gonna be."
Ward 3 Councilman Ronald Ely contradicted Matyja on a number of points. Ely admitted, "the city will pay for infrastructure improvements," though he added that such changes "will need to be done eventually anyway." Regarding the port authority bonds, Ely argued, "investors are the ones at risk not us," noting that Wickliffe "will only need to pay the port authority if land values increase." Moreover, Ely stressed, "the bonds will stop if the development does not meet Wickliffe City Code."

The electricity will be sold to PG&E and Southern California Edison.
It takes a while. Davies begins the film with words – Rachel Weisz’ Hester reading what sounds like a love letter. But it is, we soon realize, a suicide note. And with classical music throbbing, we watch as she takes pills, turns on the gas and then disappears into a pure reverie of images.
The large, active mural was created by New York artist Hildreth Meière, best known for her art deco style of the 1920s and ’30s, especially the domes and ceilings in the Nebraska State Capitol and the medallions on Radio City Music Hall.

"I don't know if it's a good problem to have, but it's one that I'm putting off until the last possible moment," Hitchcock said. "I don't even want to think about it because I know if I start thinking about it, something is going to happen ... a guy might get dinged up, or whatever. To me, I'm going to wait until the playoffs start before I make that determination. I just feel like I owe it to both guys to continue to play both guys."

While at an annual Tech athletic department workshop last week, Weaver said it dawned on him that a change was needed in the men's basketball program in order to foster the family atmosphere he sought.
Dear Mr. Dad: My mother-in-law has an opinion on every conceivable parenting topic. The problem is that those opinions are usually unwelcome and unhelpful. Besides that, every time she's at my house, she insists on telling me (and my wife when she's there) how we should raise our children. What can I do before I snap?

None of the roughly two-dozen reader submissions sent to letters@latimes.com (two of which were published on Monday's page) even attempted to note a remotely apologetic aspect of AT&T's grip on California lawmakers. Some readers pointed to the story as Exhibit A in the case for campaign finance reform; others were incredulous over legislators' attempts to deny that AT&T's lavish gift-giving in Sacramento had much influence at all over laws and regulations.
Little nippers: The Grand Wailea has long been an all-ages destination for its elaborate swimming complex, which includes the 25,700-square-foot Wailea Canyon Activity Pool.

A month after Christie’s announcement, members of the public broadcasting authority have received no detailed blueprint for the split, although state officials have met with interim NJN executive director Howard Blumenthal. Christie’s proposal includes leaving $2 million for the rest of 2010 — and the slashing of 129 NJN employees from the state payroll come Jan. 1, 2011. However, there are no specifics available about the ownership of the licenses, the division of property — including equipment, the studios in Trenton, Newark and Camden, and the broadcasting towers — or the division of income from deals with for-profit companies seeking to lease the network’s bandwidth.
Over the full fiscal year, Best Buy lost $1.2 billion, or $3.36 a share. That compares with a $1.3-billion profit, or $3.08, a year earlier. Revenue increased 2% to $50.7 billion, although same-store sales were down 1.7%.

You need a little black dress. I'm a fan of a high neckline; it's a vintage look that I like a lot. I went on tour this summer with my sister. We went to 30 cities and hit all of the vintage stores we could find. We found the best fashions in New York City, of course, but Portland was my favorite place with the most vintage stores. The fashions there aren't totally my style, but the people really are themselves. They don't care what anyone thinks. I saw someone looking cool in a belted garbage bag and mismatched boots. Totally acceptable! I love to wear items from the places I've been, that's important to me.
Traveling through China some years ago, I was surprised to see acupuncturists offering their services in hotel lobbies alongside the shoeshine stands, snack racks and gift shops. Some members of our group availed themselves, with no ill effects and, they said, some relief for aching backs or sore shoulders.
"She's in a position where she's so much better than the rest of our team that it could easily be Lindsey and then the rest of the team. But it's not like that at all," he said. "She is a really good kid, and the other girls respond to that. We're gonna miss her a lot for many reasons other than just the scores she shoots."

The rules of low fares are evolving quickly as airlines recover from the recession. Last year, procrastination was the name of the game. Because travel demand was sluggish, airlines discounted seats or launched fare sales close to flight time. But this year, travel demand is inching up and airlines have slimmed their fleets - the perfect equation for higher fares.
They should save their energy. They are better off trying to understand Jackson himself.

These disparate victims are connected now, sharing a date on the calendar, a fluke of timing, but also something else: Their deaths have fed a sense that something has come undone. But also, that maybe these deaths will finally spur change.
More days went by. They signed up with Find Toto (www.findtoto.com) -- basically an Amber Alert (or in this case, an Am"Bear" Alert) system for pets. Automated calls go out to thousands of people in a radius around the pet's last known location. I'd never heard of such a thing, but it's totally cool, and one tip came from that. At least they knew he was still in the area, still alive. At one point, Christy and Ryan even worked with an animal psychic, who suggested places to look and assured them they would find their beloved dog before they left town.
"You see that they're coming forward for the first time," said Command Sgt. Major Edward Mills, the Guard's top enlisted soldier. "They feel like they can come to us, and we are not going to hold it against them."

After Watney eliminated Woods, Golf Channel/NBC, which had interviewed all the winners, first, went to Woods. He delicately was asked about the result. He gave no credit to Watney, who played very well, and he was not asked one question about Watney’s play. Only Tiger can beat Tiger, ya know?

William Saroyan, the daring young writer from Fresno, lived and wrote in the Inner Sunset, drank in the city's bars, roamed its streets -- "every block a short story, every hill a novel," he said. In his classic play "The Time of Your Life," set in a San Francisco saloon, he proclaimed his mantra: "In the time of your life, live, so that in that wondrous time you shall not add to the misery and sorrow of the world, but shall smile to the infinite variety and mystery of it."
Are we surprised that "American Reunion" — the latest in the surprisingly lasting "American Pie" series — starts with a dual masturbatory scene? Are we surprised young women in bikinis, lingerie and much less dominate many of the film's familiar shots? Or that Stifler (Seann William Scott) rocks a "Orgasm Donor" T-shirt throughout a lengthy scene? Or that the film is rated R for crude and sexual content, nudity, language, drug use and teen drinking?
But it works only if Woods shows a little personality. Tell some stories. Crack a (PG-rated) joke. Display a small slice of warmth.

Like "Sarah Marshall," "The Five-Year Engagement" touches on themes of love found and lost in a serious way, and to its credit, it does find some moments of emotional truth amid the inconsistent laughs. But man, it can be a messy slog to get to them.
The letter to parents from Geno, the centers' executive director, asks parents for continued support and attendance at a fundraiser, an auction, on Feb. 24.

In Borneo, wildfires, logging and palm oil plantations have helped wipe out most of the orangutans' natural habitat. Indonesia, which boasts the most tropical forests in the world after Brazil, continues to lose millions of forest acres each year, thanks to the rising popularity of palm oil as a cooking oil and biofuel. The forests are burned, the peat swamps drained, and palm trees are planted instead.

BRANCHBURG — Two township brothers face charges following a child pornography investigation, the Somerset County Prosecutor’s Office said.
In front of children, in professional settings and in polite company, most Americans no longer think it is OK to make racist jokes about black people. We recognize that it is both hurtful and inaccurate to judge someone's intentions by their skin color or ethnic origin. But when it comes to Muslims and people from Muslim countries, we lose those same sensibilities. So why do my kind, liberal-minded friends make such comments without realizing the offense they're causing?
7. Follow the money. Very few people speak without financial motive or incentive. The casino companies are pouring money into the campaigns and slush funds of Florida politicians. So are the existing tourism businesses that don't want the competition. In general, there are some legitimate arguments on both sides. But don't expect those points to come from those getting paid to make them.

Not only was Jankalski going too fast in a six-knot zone, but, the officer discovered, the Jet Ski had the wrong kind of registration decal on its side, had no registration card on board and was not equipped with a horn or a whistle — four violations of Maryland's maritime laws, which apply equally to all vessels, no matter how small. Jankalski, who was visiting from Shrewsbury, Pa., and her uncle, Ronald Ridings, who had been waiting on a dock nearby, got off with a warning.
Pronouncements are tricky things, but it’s a safe bet that you will not see another movie this year like “The Artist.”
Mildred Loving, who died in 2008, apparently didn't think much of the 1996 movie "Mr. and Mrs. Loving," starring Lela Rochon and Timothy Hutton. She would like "The Loving Story," especially hearing her husband (killed in a car accident in 1975) say, "I love my wife." That's one thing viewers will remember; another is the final freeze frame on Mildred's face.
But what Camp -- and, it would appear, plenty of other teachers can't fathom -- is why there hasn't been a peep about demanding more from parents.

"Serve your guests hot mulled wine. As most Bay Area folk, I would never dream of tainting my wine with spices, but when it was described to me as hot sangria, my mind changed, and from that point, I was sold. It's delicious and more familiar to Americans when served with fruit slices in it."
She said she did not see that front right corner of her husband's Mercedes SUV was damaged until the next morning. Although she said she was certain she wasn't involved in the fatal accident even after she learned of it through a news report, her husband contacted an attorney who turned the car over to the State Patrol the night of Aug. 24. She did not acknowledge she was the driver until Sept. 2.

Christmas is a time for wines that you can enjoy through the day, so dig into the cellar (or the closet) for those special bottles you've been saving. Never was there a better time to share. It's also a time for more opulent flavors; as wonderful as a racy Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio (with a few exceptions) may be, you want wines that stand up to the sort of lavish recipes that require one last bit of traditional belt-loosening before the new year. If you want one all-purpose wine to serve during the day, choose Champagne. But why choose one wine?

I don't think fans need to hit the panic button by any means. If there are more departures it might raise a red flag, but Brown has a history of transferring (he went to three high schools in four years, leaving Findlay Prep in the middle of the season when he was a junior) and Barron wasn't playing much, so it's hard to get a read on him. The most interesting part of Altman's post game press conference last night was that he seemed very sad to me. For a no-nonsense guy like Altman, this was a little different demeanor.

Jason Cole, Yahoo! Sports: "(Ryan) Tannehill is a project. It may be three years before the team really knows what he is. He may not play much, if at all, as a rookie. While some fans hear that analysis and recoil in a Pavlovian fear created by years of watching the 17 quarterbacks go under center for the Dolphins since (Dan) Marino retired (say the name A.J. Feeley to a Dolphins fan and watch that person go into the fetal position), those same fans need to understand reality. If you want to solve the quarterback position, you have to invest in it. Whether it's money or draft picks or whatever, quarterbacks aren't found at the Dollar Store. You can bring up Tom Brady as a sixth-round pick all you want to, but the counter is Peyton Manning, Eli Manning, Ben Roethlisberger and Aaron Rodgers. They have combined to win six of the past seven Super Bowls. All of them were first-round picks."

If a host is looking to really deviate from tradition, throwing a shower for the bride and the groom is a definite way to mix things up. "Co-ed showers are becoming really popular," Naylor said.

Now this needs to be done a good month before the wedding because you don't want anybody injured."

In the 1980s, the negotiations started not with a plan from the White House or Congress but from an independent and bipartisan commission chaired by Alan Greenspan.

A small group of lawmakers have held "pro-forma" sessions every three days. These involve the quick use of a gavel to call a session to order -- and to immediately conclude it. Doing this seemingly fulfilled a constitutional requirement for avoiding a recess, which served singular purpose: to keep the president from going around the Senate during the winter break and making a recess appointment. Or so members thought.

The Democrat budget relies on more optimistic revenue figures and is roughly $1 billion higher than the governor’s plan.

Palo Alto was the most surprisingly sexed-up burb in the whole mix. It turns out that 1 in 5,000 in Palo Alto are seeking anal. compared to San Francisco, where 1 in 4,000 are looking for backdoor action, Palo Alto may seem paltry for the anal enthusiast and lube salesman alike (in both cases, 27 percent are M4M). But considering that in most Bay Area cities in my survey only 1 in 10,000 are seeking anal, Palo Alto is actually seeking twice as much anal action as the rest of the Bay Area.

Those that say home ownership should be a thing of the past only have dollar signs in their eyes. They make the mistake of thinking the only reason people aspire to be homeowners is the dream of making a killing when they sell their home someday. Or, they want to be able to utilize the equity they build in their homes to finance the luxuries of life. While this attitude by some contributed to our economic challenges, the truth is home ownership was never meant to be a get-rich-quick scheme.

One problem with this strategy is that those laws are barely adequate to police misuse of large sums by politicians running for office, much less politicians running around. What prosecutors will try to do is show that Edwards' real purpose was to keep his secret from voters, not from his wife, with money subject to disclosure and other laws.

At that size, it will be bigger than the Safeway at Southeast Cesar E. Chavez and Powell boulevards.
"He has done some good things," Spencer said. "He knows what we're trying to do. … He has been around long enough, so he should know it.''
Gov. Mark Dayton hit the nail on the head when he spoke of "prejudice against public school teachers," but to undercut education reform will only perpetuate the problem ("Teacher-tenure veto halts a top GOP priority," May 4). Students, teachers and taxpayers have been held hostage for years by outdated, protectionist union regulations that defy common sense and damage the opportunity for students to get an education by putting bad teachers ahead of good students. No wonder the public is frustrated. Unfortunately, teachers who may not even support Education Minnesota or their PAC are forced to be members and bear the brunt of the frustration that should go to the union itself and DFL legislators. For years, the teachers union, Education Minnesota, has funded DFL campaigns, and the DFL has supported the union's stranglehold on education. Students, parents and taxpayers are completely out of the loop. Teachers may have to stand up for themselves. They do deserve better, and this reform would have opened the door for building a better future for them and their students.

Overall, it's fair to say the Orthodox Church has flown below the radar in American culture since it first came to North America in the eighteenth century through Russian missionary settlements in Alaska and via droves of immigrants from Eastern Mediterranean and East European countries beginning in the late nineteenth century. Indeed, it is often through ethnic events - whether Greek, Romanian, Serbian, Bulgarian, Russian, or Arab – that people first become acquainted with the Orthodox Church. So it's not unusual that encounters with the Orthodox begin through one's appetite for baklava or pirogy, or perhaps while attending a friend's "Big Fat Greek Wedding".

Kane County Clerk John A. "Jack" Cunningham, 73, scored a political victory this week, fighting his way back onto the Republican primary ballot against Rep. Judy Biggert, 74.

A circuit court judge agreed that was a poor reason to disenfranchise the hundreds of voters who signed those sheets. It was a good call.

The report cites a national study suggesting that a majority of teachers in the U.S. believe it is important to teach students to effect social change. But is that sort of politicization pervasive at UC? The report makes much of the political predilections of the faculty. Citing research from early in this decade, it points to dramatic disproportions in the ideology and party identifications of UC faculty in the humanities and social sciences. For example, it cites a 2004 study showing that Democrats in Berkeley's social sciences departments outnumbered Republicans by 21 to 1. Imbalances like that are eye-opening, but they don't prove that professors are pressing their politics on their students or are incapable of exploring other points of view.

“It’s a wonderful impersonation,” a critic said to me as we left the screening, and I noted the choice of words, and the old charge against Streep – it’s all technique, no feeling.

In the 1980s, while non-Angelenos may have assumed that Milliken and Feniger were impressing customers with their exoticisms, the truth was that the chefs assumed most of the people in the dining room had tasted these things in their original form. Not all of their customers had been to Thailand, Lisbon or India, but a lot of them had; if not, Thai Town, Little Tokyo and Little India were not far away.

Rutgers' sophomore running back, though, has settled on option C.
If you wanted to try to put an educational spin on it - and people did want to do that - you could argue that we live in a diverse world and kids ought to get used to that sooner rather than later. Plus, the black kids from the city who were going to the county would be going to better schools than the schools in the city.
"He was always a talented kid," Zduriencik said. "If you look back on his record, even the first year he competed in the Midwest League way back when, he was an all-star. It is kind of remarkable to see the length of time he's been off to accomplish what he's accomplished.

Last July, Andrew Koski, 48, pleaded guilty to hindering a game warden and was fined $632. Each also could face revoked hunting privileges in Nevada and more than 30 other states, under a multi-state compact
In technology, size isn't always an asset, as HP is learning. One of the biggest challenges for Whitman will be to figure out how big HP needs to be. It's a key question that has tripped up a string of CEOs, from Carly Fiorina and her hard-fought battle to buy Compaq Computer, to Mark Hurd and his $20 billion acquisition spree and 50,000 job cuts, and Apotheker's poorly received plan to steer HP away from lower-margin areas of computer hardware.
Deluxxe, whose real name is Ed Dobski, calls bingo the first weekend of the month. The Waterford native and onetime local radio personality is 41 and lives in Orlando, where he works as activity director at a nursing home.
Aardman, those meticulous Brits who build clay models and painstakingly animate them into Wallace & Gromit cartoons and the hit "Chicken Run," tip their hand that way with "The Pirates! Band of Misfits." A pirate picture that's entirely too late to the party to have much in the line of fresh pirate gags, it is stuffed with name voice actors, from Hugh Grant as The Pirate Captain to Salma Hayek, Brendan Gleeson, Imelda Stanton, Anton Yelchin and Jeremy Piven.

øThe concept of multiple Earths has been a part of DC lore for decades. While the Justice League of Batman, Superman, Green Lantern and Wonder Woman has long been the main superhero team of Earth 1, the Justice Society of America - a group that first debuted in comics in 1940, predating the Justice League - was the major heroic force of Earth 2 before various story lines brought them all together.
Then, a plot twist. Red Springs must, by the terms of its operator's agreement, use the facility as a cafe, and not just for catering. Red Springs' agreement is with the Chesapeake Center for Youth Development, a social service organization for at-risk youth that leases the diner from city. Operators of the diner, like Townsend, are also contractually obligated to collaborate with the organization's workforce development program.

The seventh-ranked Hilltoppers pulled within 11-10 with 12:20 left in the game on goals by Anna McGovern and Allison Moloney, who had four goals each. Cardozo responded when Chierico scored off a pass from Thalina Urena and Zhang scored coming across the goal mouth to extend the lead to 13-10 with 5:34 remaining. McGovern felt her team might have taken Cardozo a bit for granted after beating them last year in a scrimmage.

Look, I have never pretended to be any kind of housekeeper. It's not fun, it's not a point of pride, it's not something I need to feel content with my lot in life.

It's a win for political expedience and a loss for California voters who thought they had required legislators to honestly meet the budget deadline as a condition of maintaining their paychecks. This "no budget, no pay" requirement was one of the selling points of Prop. 25, the 2010 measure that lowered the threshold for passing a budget from two-thirds to a simple majority.

If one person's experiences were enough to prove that healthy habits ensure a long and vigorous life, Hempel would be the toast of the medical community. Through a mix of wise choices, natural inclination and random chance, she seems to have followed just about every bit of standard advice on living to a healthy old age -- and has achieved impressive results. Of course anecdotal evidence only goes so far, and not everybody is equally lucky. But to some extent, Hempel has created her own luck.
A bigger corporate presence at Team NEO won't change what local business groups are doing to keep companies here and help them grow, said Dan Colantone, president and chief executive of the Greater Akron Chamber.

The meal ended the way it began, with a showstopping surprise a cup of rich warm chocolate with thick whipped cream, and a little shot of bitter German beer. Our waiter suggested that we alternate sips -- first chocolate and then beer.

Indeed, from the moment the Yankees bowed out of the American League Division Series in October, losing a decisive Game 5 at home to the Detroit Tigers, Cashman said his one and only goal this off-season was to improve his team’s pitching. When it didn’t happen at the winter meetings, Cashman shrugged and preached patience. But as December turned to January, it was starting to look like the Yankees would head to Tampa with Sabathia and Nova followed by some combination of Phil Hughes, A.J. Burnett and Freddy Garcia. Now, it appears Hughes, Burnett and Garcia will have to battle for one spot. Or Hughes could return to the bullpen, where he excelled in 2009.
It was a good "first impression for his people and for the world," said Hajime Izumi, a North Korea expert at Japan's Shizuoka University. "He demonstrated that he can speak in public fairly well, and at this stage that in itself - more than what he actually said - is important. I think we might be seeing him speak in public more often, and show a different style than his father."
The idea for a one-stop shop for online giving came from the Minnesota Community Foundation, said Nelson. The foundation concocted the concept, created the business plan and hired Nelson.
Nothing really prepares you for your first glimpse of the Drynachan Valley, set within the vast Cawdor estate in the Scottish Highlands. Having driven across a near lunar landscape of desolate moorland, you turn a bend and drop down into a steep pine wood. Through the trees, you catch sight of green pastures and the peaty water of the River Findhorn running through them. "Argentina and Montana are the only other places I've been to that look like this," says Isabella Cawdor, who has known this valley since she first visited it in her early 20s.

Bird flu is lethal more than half of the time it strikes humans. It is also very hard for humans to catch. Most people who have developed bird flu have been in close contact with infected birds; only a few have gotten sick from very close contact with infected people. But virologists and public health officials have worried that the virus might have the potential to mutate so that it could pass more easily between humans, through droplets in the air.

When it comes to these kind of supplements, it should be said that Muscle Milk seems to be one of the better-tasting ones. A couple of years ago, while attending the annual Arnold Sports Festival in Columbus (a multisport fitness competition), a group of us sampled about 10 different brands of these liquid protein supplements, and Muscle Milk was by far the least powdery-tasting brand.

As in a lot of movies these days, though, the supporting actors are the real draw. Ed Burns, who is beginning to look like Brian Williams’ more-fun brother, is fine as Banks’ friend; as Nick’s old partner, Anthony Mackie is, as always, as cool and sharp as an icicle.

The fiercely expressed determination in GOP ranks to oust Mr. Obama, voiced repeatedly by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in his battle cry to make him "a one-term president," seems to have lost some of its zeal amid the civil war for the party nomination. The wish may be undiminished, but the conviction that it will be achieved now lacks the previous certitude.

My New Year's bet: Even if former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney places second, he's a victor. He's already won the resource battle. Romney is like the Southern generals in the Civil War, holding off the opposition until it runs out of ammunition. Until the Newt Gingrich surge, Romney held his fire in Iowa and focused on must-win New Hampshire. In recent days his campaign and friendly political action committees have poured millions into negative campaign ads that imploded Gingrich's rising star.

But although Weinstein might be pressing the issue to benefit his company, that doesn't render the issue invalid. An R rating covers an overly broad range of cinematic territory, from an extra couple of four-letter words to racy simulations of sex acts and full frontal nudity as well as persistent and extreme violence. Yet for all of these, the attendance rules are the same.
The dismissal comes three days before Dior is set to unveil Mr. Galliano's fall-winter 2011/2012 collection before the world's fashion critics and retail buyers at Paris Fashion Week. But the severity of the designer's remarks meant Dior had to act, says a person close to the company.

Dr. Hoffmann says for many high-risk patients like Coleman, it's safer to use general anesthesia administered through an IV because the levels of sedation are more precise. But that costs more money and requires much more training. Dentists can be certified in oral sedation using relaxants and sleeping pills after only passing an 18-hour course.

The move is a dramatic reversal for Amazon, which has fought hard across the country against being forced to collect state sales taxes. Texas law requires companies with a physical presence in Texas to collect sales tax. After Combs concluded last year that the company owed $269 million in uncollected sales taxes, Amazon closed down the warehouse and argued it did not qualify under the law. The deal announced Friday settled that dispute.

Even though you have every right to appear on your tenants' doorstep, it might prove unproductive and not resolve the problem of the unpaid gas bills. You also should write them a letter stating if they don't contact you within a week to resolve the issue or pay the outstanding gas bills, you will be forced to evict them.

Blue Plate, and more established Chenin-philes like Pine Ridge, have long turned to the grape's obscure California home - Clarksburg, the little-known Sacramento River delta appellation, a place that has managed to hold on to its modest plantings over the years. Despite the constant temptation to plant Chardonnay, Clarksburg's fate seems auspiciously tied with Chenin, enough that a Gerald Asher article once called it "the right grape in the right place."

Debates have turned facile superiority into an art form. The charade of engagement is so popular with the candidates because they can deflect any question that pushes their feet toward the fire.

But the key here isn't in any conventional element, it's in the sustained air of sketch-comedy absurdism, the comically overdone gestures, the random bursts of joyfully naive dance and song (although the Katie Griesar score doesn't stand out here as much as usual), and little curlicues of language and logic. When Cinder first decides she needs a cleaner, she picks up the phone and say, "Can I have the number for the Yellow Pages?" Later on, Ink Blot (played with customary verve by Mouawad), confesses, "My father, he beat me with a calendar on the 31st of every month." (Prompting the quizzical response, "So, not every month?")

The firing of Hue Jackson? Had it been done in a vacuum, it might have signified little more than the team's continuing drift.

As with the calamari, the gnocchi ($8) is plated in a pool, here of lemony butter that drips off every forkful. Soft and delicately flavored with milky ricotta and astringent chard, the gnocchi are topped with fork-tender squash and bright squash blossoms. The tastiest entree is the hearty Sweet Briar Farms Pork Blade Chop ($19). While the pork is tender and sweet, the accompanying gratinéed tomatoes add more crunch than flavor. But the star of the dish is the zucchini-potato cakes which, because they absorb the juices from the pork and the tomatoes, contain all the multi-layered abundance of gorgeous flavor so sorely lacking in many of the other Daily Cafe foods.

A: Honda says it is not planning to develop a direct replacement for the Element. However, the car maker has been guiding fans of the discontinued vehicle to its new CR-V compact crossover.

Our deep admiration for the honeybee and sympathy for its mysterious plight gave us an idea for a great spring brunch. In the spirit of spring fever, we recommend a kitchen challenge: guests create dishes using the secret ingredient of local honey, from such L.A.-based suppliers as Kirk's Local Honey and Feral Honey & Bee. Now is when healthy bees are busy foraging new wildflowers and budding blossoms to make the sweetest, spiciest honey of the year. As part of the growing urban farming movement, it's possible to find honey crafted from the flowers in your very own town or neighborhood. With each guest as chef, taster and community supporter, brunch becomes a culinary arena. But finally the proof is in the honey itself. A symbolic tribute to the very essence of spring will call forth the Iron Chef in every cook.

His opinion is entitled to change, but if Booker is labeling Vanderbeek “one of the most despicable owners” in the NHL, we’ll just assume he’s too busy tweeting to keep up with the league.

Portland residents may decide the costs are well worth the benefits. The city has many excellent schools and many improving ones, even under today's conditions.

As most major American cities have learned the hard way, it's almost impossible to get the schools back once they're gone.

The worst stench of all is the campaign's reliance on the so-called Huron report, which is nothing but a late-coming PowerPoint presentation based on a lot of guesswork about tax credits, possible changes in technology and possible changes in the cost of producing solar energy.

Bryan has been on fire lately with his character, and unfortunately for Sheamus, all eyes are on DBryan going into WrestleMania, despite Sheamus having won the Royal Rumble.

There are some cases when a needle biopsy can't be performed. Depending on where the growth is located, it might be too close to the chest wall to safely use a needle. Also, if a needle biopsy results don't align with the physician's original assessment, then a more invasive approach may be needed. There are simple questions you can ask your doctor to determine whether he or she offers this procedure. Ask how they approach a biopsy - percutaneously or open? Also ask if he or she is OK with you getting a second opinion. Your doctor should be comfortable with it. If he or she appears angry, it should be a red flag to the patient. It's most important for you as the patient to be comfortable and feel like you have a connection with your physician.

A: Hey, Brian: Massaquoi missed a lot of work, but the good news is he worked with McCoy and the other skill position players in the four Camp Colts during the lockout. So he's not coming in entirely out of the cold. I think he will benefit from the switch to the West Coast system. As for Pinkston, we will only find out during the regular-season games. I do think the Browns will be looking for a guard with experience -- just in case. Billy Yates would look real good right now.

His visitors over decades included Cuban netters, shipwrecked sailors and tourists from the coast, the poet Carl Sandburg among them. Something happened to the pine to make the trunk split in a peculiar way. At least that's what Terry was told. Some folks say the Indians did it. The less romantic wonder if hurricane winds might have done the trimming. Anyway, the double trunk reminded people of the musical instrument.

For instance, on June 29, Cincinnati's 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals turned back a challenge, originating in Michigan, to the Patient Protection law's coverage requirement.

The final word on that, of course, will come from the U.S. Supreme Court.

From Billboard: Blunderbuss' has elements of nearly every project he's worked on  even some of the 1950s bounce of the White-produced Wanda Jackson album on I'm Shakin' ' and Trash Tongue'  but also shows sides that the self-imposed, regimented simplicity of the White Stripes didn't allow. There are softer piano-driven songs (Love Interruption') and, at the opposite extreme, filthy guitar raunch (16 Saltines'), but also elaborate tracks reminiscent of late-'60s psychedelia, like the Zombies or Small Faces. Hip (Eponymous) Poor Boy' in particular is unlike anything White's ever done, with a complex, hop-scotching melody and rhythm; similarly, I Guess I Should Go to Sleep' has a soaring vocal, a jazzy tempo and a violin solo. With a sound that's vintage and organic but also very clean, the album is so diverse that virtually every song comes as a surprise.
Oh man, Merle Dixon (portrayed by Michael Rooker) is so cool. He's like Daryl Dixon except without all the namby pambiness and pussyfooting.

To accommodate January Jones' pregnancy while filming began on Season 5 (and probably to give her a better storyline this year), the writers have decided to make her big. How big? I mean, she's not HUGE. She's, well, like medium-muumuu territory. I must say that January Jones never seemed to sport a double-chin while really pregnant, so I'm assuming there's some clever makeup/prosthetics going on here.

A Noguchi garden and rows of formal white camellia Japanese-style hedges edge a wide path bordering the Tea Garden fence wall. It narrows to a walkway toward JFK Drive.

Still, the addition of three-time Pro Bowl receiver Brandon Marshall ate up quite a bit of salary-cap space for the Bears. He'll count $9.5 million in 2012. The Bears could, however, convert that high base salary into a signing bonus, lower his base salary to the veteran minimum of $715,000 and save about $5.8 million in space. But, the Bears would create problems in 2013, since Marshall's projected base salary is $9.3 million.

Chinese consumers are so used to bootlegs that particular pirate "brands" with names like Red Dragon, Monkey King and Pegasus have loyal followings. Some of the more established pirate brands are experimenting with watermarks of their own, in an effort to distinguish their products from those made by smaller bootleg outfits.

The Olympics are (almost) back, and it's a good time to sing again the ballad of Jesse Owens, the black American track star who put the lie to Adolf Hitler's master-race malarkey at the 1936 Summer Olympics by winning four gold medals.

Events like the Pakistan shrine bombing, which killed eight people, of course take their toll at once. But religious intimidation, too, unleashes waves that weaken whole societies. Attack a minority faith, extremists know, and in the process you freeze free speech, chill thinking, and silence the very leaders - women and men - best suited for democracy.
øI do. I like venison. When you're in L.A. it's hard to get venison, so my dad would bring it out for me. I do a lot of smoked venison, venison jerky, sausages, stuff like that. I like alligator, crawfish, I've had all that stuff. I want to take one of these (teammates) with me.

Hospitality takes practice, and it has consequences. In my own tradition, the Eucharist is a place where we both learn and practice hospitality. God welcomes us to a feast that he provides with his own flesh and blood, and through it He offers us an ongoing opportunity to be wholly transformed. When Eucharistic hospitality becomes a habit, we start asking questions of ourselves and of the world in which we live. We remember that the church is not ours, but God's, and act accordingly. We begin to ask if our public policies, both foreign and domestic, reflect our value of hospitality. We seek active ways to make our hearts and homes places of gracious welcome, even at the risk of being made uncomfortable, or being asked to change.

“A day later, it is still hard to believe,” Belichick said in a statement. “Of all the players I have coached, nobody was more full of energy and vitality than Junior Seau. He respected and inspired every single person he came in contact with — players, coaches and support staff. He defied the odds by playing two decades in the NFL at a level and with a youthful spirit rarely seen but appreciated by everyone. Junior will always be remembered as an intense Hall of Fame player from the old school. He was a charismatic icon. At the same time, as a human being he was as caring, warm and lovable as they come. That’s what I will miss most of all. It was a privilege to have coached Junior Seau. My condolences to his family.”

Caterer Chad Harris' menu is simple, but the ingredients all have a pedigree. The chicken in the Nashville Hot Chicken is from Fulton Valley; the crispy battered wing, thigh and drumstick are piled on a sturdy slice of bread, which helps to soak up the copious amount of grease.

Though Henderson is not himself a blues fanatic, during his first visit he immediately surmised that the performers in the Dell--and their audience--were the real deal.

• Thunder 111, Blazers 107 -- Darnell Mayberry, Oklahoman: This was a great win. By far the best of the season. It wasn’t always pretty. But when you’re the best (by record), you’re going to get everyone’s best, and it’s going to sometimes be hard-nosed, physical contest. That’s what this was. And the fact that the Thunder came into the Rose Garden, where the Blazers had only lost once in 12 games, and slayed a team that was whupping opponents by an average of 18.3 points in their building, speaks volumes.

Every now and then, I will think of a pizza so good that my mouth will actually start watering, even though it's a pizza I can enjoy only in my memories. I've had pizza in Chicago, pizza in Las Vegas and pizza in California (ugh). But I will never, ever have a pizza as wonderful as a Carlo's Pizza. Carlo's was located in Solon and was a short drive from my home in Chagrin Falls. I would eat a Carlo's pizza (sausage, double cheese) twice a week. I've never had better homemade sausage, never had better cheese or crust. And if you dined in, you could savor something else -- a superb jukebox with Sinatra and Dino. If I could ever have a "back to the future" moment, it would take place at Carlo's Pizza. -- Barry Goodrich, Russell.

His voice is rich, Scottish, oily and duplicitous — the snake in the Garden of Eden sounded exactly like this. Indeed, it's hard to have a phone conversation with McDiarmid without picturing him on the other end shriveled up in hatred, his eyes burning in resentment, his face cloaked inside shadows, plotting the demise of the Jedi. But as unseemly as that is — to gloss over decades of celebrated stage work and a best actor Tony (for his role alongside Ralph Fiennes in the 2006 Broadway production of "Faith Healer") — pretending McDiarmid wasn't central to"Star Wars" is no easier than pretending Paul McCartney wasn't in the Beatles.

"In these times of shrinking budgets, and federal cutbacks and state cutbacks, you can't have a big budget. This is a high-impact, low-cost approach to affect the wellness of the community."
Roberts concludes "Pavane" with a somewhat problematic coda, one that compels the reader to think again about the action of the novel and of the church's role in it. He also suggests that history is governed by a kind of eternal recurrence, that once before, "beyond all the memories of men, there was a great civilization" that rose and flourished until there came "a burning, an Armageddon."
Many of our editors aren't fans of the touch-screen system because it takes a long time to switch between menus and because you have to use the screen to access features like the heated seats and steering wheel.

The Alpine nation gave local authorities permission in May to destroy expired swine flu vaccines after finding its storerooms were full of unused stock. A total of 20 people died from swine flu in Switzerland — out of almost 5,000 across Europe.

Nothing wrong with dreaming. Heck, three NFL teams drafted four rookie starters just last year. Of course, those teams had a collective 40 picks to pull off the feat. The Bears have six selections, and they are choosing late in rounds as punishment for an 11-5 season that included hosting - and losing - the NFC Championship Game against the Green Bay Packers. The Bears fielded one rookie starter in that game, right tackle J'Marcus Webb, a seventh-round pick.

The game also featured a bounceback effort from maligned point guard Raymond Felton. One game after his two hideous late-game blunders cost the Blazers a win over the Utah Jazz, Felton nearly registered a triple double, finishing with 14 points, nine assists and eight rebounds. His best stretch of the game -- and maybe the season -- came in the third quarter, when he was tossing alley-oop lobs to Nicolas Batum and Hickson and swishing three-pointers as the Blazers built a 13-point lead.

Consumer product companies across the board have been raising prices to deal with higher costs for materials like pulp, fuel and packaging. P&G's rival Kimberly-Clark said last week that higher prices helped boost its quarterly earnings 34 percent.

The problem now isn't FDR or Stalin. It isn't the tension between us and Russia. The problem is that a people were exterminated and we only cared to pay attention when it fueled our animosity with our arch enemy during the Cold War.

After more than 12 years as a trial court and court of appeals judge, and more years than that being tangentially involved with judicial issues as an attorney, I firmly believe that all seven justices on our state Supreme Court -- including those up for election this year, Justices Stephen Markman and Brian Zahra -- are experienced, principled individuals with stellar reputations. Although they may disagree on many important cases, those disagreements result from differing legal views, not from who is before the court.

The company says it had been elevating the pressure because federal regulations - based on peak pressure levels - would otherwise kick in and limit its ability to meet peak demand.

Casa de Mi Padre is at its best (a relative term, mind you) when it's at its silliest and most surreal: the appearance of a mystical white mountain lion, who offers Ferrell's Armando sage counsel - and who is one of the least convincing animatronic puppets to come down the pike since comedian Soupy Sales conversed with White Fang - provides sublime guffaws.

A. Observation of the whacking and hacking around town says there are many options when it comes to the care of crape myrtles. You are also going to find that many gardeners choose to do nothing and let the shrubs or small trees grow naturally and they do just fine. Others like to prune off the old fruit capsules which you refer to as berries. These are cut back to a point on the stems about the diameter of your finger.

Joe Jonas -- he's the one with the straightened locks, but if you need to be told that, you probably haven't read this far -- started dating Belle soon after.
"The New World" will of course include music, but it's not a musical, maybe St. Louis' theatergoers favorite form. (Thank you, Muny!) But the spring has plenty to offer that way, including two new shows at the Fox, the Broadway hit "Memphis" and the new show about competitive cheerleading, "Bring It On." For family favorites, look to the Peabody, where "Fiddler on the Roof" and "Mary Poppins" will play. And for something completely unexpected, New Line will mount John Waters' rockabilly salute to teen rebellion, "Cry-Baby," at Washington University's South Campus Theater.
Now, finding careers for more than 100,000 former bricklayers, carpenters and masons—many with mounting mortgage payments—is one of the key challenges facing Ireland.

First, I think about the very fact of Harvard. It was founded in 1636, just 15 years after that desperate first Thanksgiving. It said something about the people who created our nation that they gave education such a prominent role: Even in the wilderness of the new nation, knowledge and reason were to be the guides.
"He's a guy you can learn from, so you can't just put him on the shelf," Tressel said.

At one point, Pritchard was Allen's Golden Boy, and in the early years of Pritchard's era, the two sent waves of text messages to each other, and talked excitedly during games from Allen's courtside seats. But near the end of Pritchard's three-year run, Allen viewed Pritchard as too visible, too audible and too mischievous. Allen sent a messenger to Pritchard months before he was fired, saying he was no longer welcomed to sit next to him at Rose Garden games.

Salac could not immediately say just how many additional flights over Central and Northern North Jersey would result from JFK’s departure changes. About 575 flights per day depart from JFK, though many of those are European flights that would head east over the Atlantic, while still others would head north or south. But half of all JFK’s proposed redesigned departure routes — six of 12 — would fly over the state’s north-central core, while two additional routes would send jets over the shore counties clear down to Delaware Bay.

The judges were harsh on Portland's smugness, where "it can feel like you’re not a real local unless you own a chicken coop or make beer in your bathtub," according to Manning. That cost from Portland seven points, compared to just four taken from Seattle for "turning their noses up at people who order ... a tall skinny split-shot latte with half a shot of vanilla."
Anthony Hopkins won the Cecil B. DeMille Award, the Foreign Press's lifetime achievement honor. He was introduced by Gwyneth Paltrow, his co-star in "Proof," who called him both the Olivier of our time and the greatest actor of our generation. Maybe. At least that's arguable. She also referred to Hannibal Lecter, his role in "The Silence of the Lambs," as the greatest screen villain in movie history. That's not even arguable. That's just silly.
Councilman Dale Miller, a former state legislator who also got a call from the engineers' association, said he doesn't agree with the group's view.

With U.S. farmers planting the largest crop of corn in 75 years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture expects the resulting harvest to reach new records. And that could mean cheaper food for consumers. Assuming the weather cooperates, the country could produce 48 million tons of corn, up 4.5 million tons. Globally, corn production will grow by 75 million tons, or 10 percent, to 946 million tons due to record crops in the United States, China, Brazil and Ukraine, according to the USDA.
The cute, colorful marionettes hanging on the walls and the harlequin- patterned stained glass above the kitchen pass-through have been jettisoned for mirrors and polished strips of reddish-copper moabi wood, which helps open up the room. A large floating frame of pearly Venetian plaster hangs from the ceiling, adding a sophisticated elegance to the otherwise boxy room. Rich copper-brown drapes now cover the opening in front of the kitchen.

Best baseball toolbox: Louisville Slugger, Louisville, Ky. Baseball's favorite lumber yard has been turning trees into bats since 1884. The old plant has been turned into a museum for the wood swung by players such as Babe Ruth and Ted Williams. A gigantic replica bat sits out front. The Louisville Slugger is the "official bat of Major League Baseball," but competition has cut into its onetime near monopoly. Today 60 percent of major league players use the company's ash and maple bats. They keep all the specs on players' preferences (Example: Prince Fielder, first base, Milwaukee Brewers: Bat Model C271, ash, black finish, length, 33.5 inches; weight, 34 ounces). You can buy a model with your own name on it, just like the major leaguers. Only it's not – the finest grain is still set aside for the pros.

Two weeks before his Bay Area dates, Frisell was still working on the 858 Quartet's live repertoire. "Right now, I'm trying to get some brand-new things together, and there's a lot of other music that I've written in the last few years that hasn't gotten played much, that people might not have heard at all, like some things for films. And then it could also be just some of my other tunes that I play with my other groups arranged for the strings, or old standard songs. I'm not sure what all there's going to be. There's a lot we can choose from, actually."

Individually they are all good here, though Hardy's skills don't necessarily translate that well to romantic comedy -- which could have been used to good effect, but McG doesn't have the touch to pull that off. But overall they're just not given the right things to do. Even Cupid misfires occasionally. At least with these actors, we know there will be a next time.

Except in a day when "bad boys" are celebrated and the media gravitate toward scuttlebutt and salacious scandal, like flies to poop, a clean-cut young man reared by missionary parents in the fear and admonition of the Lord is ridiculed for being "too good," reviled even, mocked.

For Lynn, the lockdown extended a run in which he has allowed only 10 hits and three earned runs in 19 innings. Friday's 84-pitch outing accounted for most of the Pirates' frustration on a night when they never took an at-bat with a runner in scoring position. Lynn insists he doesn't know his numbers - a 1.42 ERA and nearly twice as many strikeouts (17) as hits allowed. He does know that a more aggressive pitching style serves him better than the nibbler's style he attempted in two starts last season.

That would be bad news for US interests in Asia, of course (goodbye to our bases in Japan, for example). But it would also leave Japan facing North Korea, China (with whom a clash over oil drilling rights in the East China Sea seems inevitable) and a rising India on its own -- and with Japan’s sea lanes, the country’s life line, looking vulnerable.

In Carrier's case, Bruininks gave her 13 months of paid leave and a 3.5 percent pay increase. This lifted her annual salary to $212,000 in time for the leave.

TAMPA — Every year on every NFL team, the Turk nervously ambles next to players in the locker room, dorm room or cafeteria, his role a designated dream killer whose only job is to signal the death knell to somebody's career.
The error by the state was the second in four months. In December, the state said it had discovered it had $320 million more than it knew, as e-checks from corporations had not been added to the general fund as they should have been. At the time, the state dismissed calls by Democrats for an independent audit, but with the errors totaling more than a half-billion dollars, Gov. Mitch Daniels has agreed to that audit. In addition, three top Department of Revenue officials will be leaving their jobs. One retired, one resigned and the commissioner, John Eckart, will resign after the tax-collection season ends.

It happened a year ago at Stanford during the second phase of her technical sport. She had gone from one left-foot hop to another smoothly enough. But by the time she landed on her right foot, ready to spring forward into the pit, she had veered off course.

Taxpayers would pay for that holiday, but Deckard's point is that it's a small giveaway compared with the $10 million the city will save each year by freezing pay raises for one year.
Only months ago, it seemed uncertain whether Obama would get the same kind of loving embrace from Hollywood that he did in the 2008 campaign. Actor and former supporter Matt Damon in particular voiced his displeasure last year, saying the president had "misinterpreted his mandate" and that he needed guts, though he used a blunter term. will.i.am, creator of that "Yes We Can" viral video that ended with the word "HOPE," said: "I don't want to hope anymore." Even Obama's top fundraisers acknowledged the mood was more muted — unavoidably, they said — than during Obama's first campaign.

After Davis’ run-scoring double, the Orioles tallied three straight singles, including another run-scoring hit by Reimold — a late-inning substitution in the seventh — that scored Davis. With the bases loaded, Wieters then took an 84 mph full-count slider over the right-field fence for a grand slam, essentially emptying U.S. Cellular Field long before the final out.

Actually, the truth hurts. We've taken quite a fall -- one that might not be obvious as Oregon busily restructures its state education leadership and mutely slogs through another year of local school cutbacks.

ChefStable gets its credibility from the relationships built between us and chefs. Whether we succeed or not depends on how I get along with the chefs. All I can do is offer common-sense advice based on my experience. With new projects, I also make a point of bringing up the hard issues -- the "what-ifs" -- regarding the future that are easy to ignore. But each project is built on the chef's vision. The challenge is keeping the place relevant and the quality high. So far, every restaurant project we have worked on has been profitable. Each has made money in the first year.

The poor Red Sox must have felt like they were facing two aces today. First was the Verlander who relied heavily on his slider as he went through the Red Sox lineup. Then came the Verlander who complements his high-90s heat with nasty curveballs. He threw two straight curves to Red Sox shortstop Mike Aviles in the eighth inning that were so good, they were almost offensive. Aviles somehow managed to hit the second one for a soft lineout to shortstop. I might give Aviles some All-Star votes for that.

Truth is, the vocalist used to be above that kind of thing. As one of the four iconoclastic emcees in Goodie Mob, his pre-Gnarls Barkley outfit, he was one of Atlanta’s most consistently interesting lyricists, and one who always articulated an offbeat perspective. Goodie Mob never sold many records, and I understand if Cee-Lo got tired of bouncing checks. We can forgive him his enthusiasm for contemporary marketing trends. His bandwagon-riding is a little tougher to pardon. “Forget You” may mark the moment when a once-great rapper began his final descent into novelty singing.

Top Picks Analysis: A.J. Smith normally isn't gun-shy about moving up in the first round and snaring a player he covets, but the embattled general manager benefited from holding his ground this year. In desperate need of a dangerous pass rusher to give the defense more bite, the Chargers had the good fortune of having one of this year's best in Ingram fall to them at the 18th overall choice. The squatty college lineman can quickly get to the edge with an explosive first step, plus he's stout enough to hold up against the run and displayed excellent lateral agility at the combine that will aid him in coverage. Another possible starter at a thin position was plucked with the second-round selection of Reyes, a powerful and hard-working prospect with the frame to work as a five-technique end in San Diego's 3-4 alignment. Smith's only trade of the draft came in the third round, when he vaulted five spots to claim Taylor, one of the steadying forces on a dominant LSU defense. He's a good tackler with some range and adequate speed, but his best asset may be in the leadership category.

During the offseason, Cardinals assistant hitting coach John Mabry went with his kids to see "Moneyball," a movie about a team that he played a supporting role in. The film, which follows the 2002 Oakland Athletics and GM Billy Beane's expanded use of statistics, is up for the Academy Awards' best picture Sunday. Mabry, who is played by David Hutchinson in the movie, said that the team wasn't "test-tube babies" for the statistical revolution as portrayed by Hollywood and that any retelling falls short when it minimizes the role of the team's top three pitchers, Tim Hudson, Barry Zito and Mark Mulder.

Even so, the mystery has lost none of its allure, consuming marine architects and amateur sleuths alike for decades. Philip Sims, a former U.S. Navy marine architect, says Ballard and his team's discovery opened up "the whole ocean of undersea wrecks," particularly because of revolutionary deep-sea technology. Sims will be a speaker today at the International Marine Forensics Symposium in National Harbor, Md., where attendees will revisit the sinking of Titanic and other famed ships.

Let's also stipulate that Mr. Nighy is one of the great comic actors of any time. Here, however, he's a glum presence in a role of bleak passivity. Ms. Smith spends most of her screen time in a wheelchair, complaining nastily about everything under the Jaipur sun. Dev Patel has been encouraged, or allowed, by the director, John Madden, to overact wildly and wave his arms grotesquely as the hotel's desperate young proprietor. Only Ms. Dench gets to play a scene worthy of her gifts. Her character, Evelyn Greenslade, has gone out and hustled herself a job at an Indian call center; suddenly she's plunged into the witty give and take of teaching a young Indian woman how to keep a client on the line. The scene is about listening well, thinking quickly and responding creatively. Unlike the rest of this inert film, it's alive.

I grew up in Wentzville and have watched it grow as well, but with these trying times we are in we all need to make sacrifices. I agree a quality education in a child's life is very important. But every other school district in St. Charles County is making cuts. I pass by Heritage Elementary every day going to and from work, and they just finished an upgrade on the entrance to the school. They could have saved that money and put it toward another improvement.
The Condos live just down the river from Yasuni National Park's riverbank clay licks. That's where thousands of parrots congregate daily to eat mineral-laden clay. They don't always show up, leaving some tourists feeling shortchanged, as if a lodge can orchestrate nature like a virtual reality concert. But we're in luck. Hundreds of green bodies stand out like florescent targets on the beige clay walls. They squawk. They flutter. They gnaw at the clay. It's happy hour at Moe's Bar.

Tressel will keep his job, on that Athletic Director Gene Smith and Gee were emphatic. And Tressel said he never thought of quitting. He has been suspended for two games and fined $250,000 by Ohio State, though the NCAA is still finishing its investigation and can impose more sanctions. You must imagine the 2010 season will be vacated since players were on the field while their coach knew they'd broken NCAA rules, and Tressel and the university could face stiffer penalties ahead.
For the last 10 years, a faithful group of Bucks County boys (ages 40-55+) has made a faithful pilgrimage to a Philadelphia Eagles road game. Last season's trip was a little different - 14 of us stopped at New Orleans for three days on our way to Arlington, Texas, for the Cowboys game.

Those who can keep socking money away. But confidence that they will be able to retire when they like, or have enough money when they do, has evaporated, along with the monthly pension check in the mail.

"Unquestionably, use of Florida public record laws by the media (in general and not just the interveners here) has become simply a tool to tell a story.

Presidential administrations came and went. Cassette tapes gave way to iPods.

The city of the title is Liverpool, the grimy port in northern England where director Terence Davies ("The House of Mirth") grew up as a triple outcast: Catholic, gay and not a fan of the hometown Beatles. Davies' passions were opera and old movies, both of which he pours into this documentary scrapbook with the tender ache of a dying Proust. His dryly poetic narration lends an added poignancy to the post-war newsreels and home movies he has artfuly assembled here. The hauntingly beautiful black-and-white footage is full of Eleanor Rigbys and Father McKenzies who are tottering toward the grave in a gray parade; yet Davies renders the melancholy majestic.

In recent years, our congregation has added the discipline of removing banners, table coverings, and table ware from the Lord's Table following communion.

"That's My Boy": After watching Adam Sandler go to broad slapstick extremes to play his twin sister in "Jack and Jill," those memories of him stretching his acting skills in "Punch-Drunk Love" are fading fast. But the "Saturday Night Live" veteran's next project could be inspired silliness, especially because it will pit him against a new-generation "SNL" star.

I just keep thinking how tragic it is that Jones's plan worked. There's an awful fatalism to how these things compute in the internet world. Evil in. Evil out. Terry Jones glows in the spotlight and pretends he thinks the loss of life is a tragedy. He doesn't.

There are three rustic but clean rooms - you'll probably want either the converted coffee shed, a light, airy space separate from the rest of the buildings, or one of the garden rooms, particularly No. 1, which is on the end and gets extra light.

(On if the West Coast offense looks he wants it to and where he would want it to go)- "There's room for improvement. I think part of that had to do with the offseason not being able to use it. I think some of the things we do are okay. Are we all a little frustrated by our offense right now? Yeah, I think so, but am I surprised? No, it did take some time to really time this thing out.

At Genoa the realignment involved rethinking the way a restaurant works. Genoa doesn't have one chef, it has four, who rotate every two weeks, each designing a fresh menu for that period.
